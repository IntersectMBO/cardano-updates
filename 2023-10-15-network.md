## High-level overview of [sprint 46][sprint-46]

### Bootstrap Peers

We continued reviewing of bootstrap peers, see [ouroboros-network#4555].

### Towards Typed Protocols 0.2.0.0

We diagnosed the performance regression of the new design. The work on
`typed-protocols` will be postponed.  For more details see the
[typed-protocols#3].  As an outcome of the performance debugging we prepared
[PR][ouroboros-network#4691] which updates the `demo-ping-pong` and
`demo-chain-sync` applications.

### Peer Sharing

We made progress in review of [ouroboros-network#4644], which simplifies the
peer sharing and fixes the [ouroboros-network#4642] issue.

### Tech Debt

We reviewed the [ouroboros-network#3836] PR which inspects all the uses of
`error` in `ouroboros-network`.  The PR was prepared by Galois.

### Main achievements

In addition to ongoing general maintenance and support of cardano environments,
some highlights of SRE achievements for this quarter include:

* All IOE cardano-parts supported node environments, including preview,
preprod, and mainnet were upgraded to cardano-node release `10.5.1`
with various additional pre-release candidate versions tested.

* Changes required for the new tracing system to become the default tracing
system have been largely implemented in cardano-node, including various
scripts, nixos services, and OCI container updates.  Similar changes supporting
the new tracing system have been also implemented elsewhere, such as the
[iohk-nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix) configuration repo,
[blockperf](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/blockperf) monitoring tool,
and nixos based
[cardano-parts](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts) node cluster
tooling stack, allowing for the upcoming cardano-node `10.6.x` release later
this year to default to the new tracing system.

* With the exception of a few canary machine deployments, all IOE testnet and
mainnet cardano-node infrastructure are now running using the new tracing
system.

* Cardano-node release binaries have been cleaned up and OCI containers now
include the snapshot-converter binary.

* [Adawallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adawallet) and the
[cardano-airgap](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-airgap) image were
feature upgraded to be compatible with operations required for the Midnight
Glacier Airdrop, including cardano-signer signing and native token UTxO
handling.

* The devx-ci cluster has been expanded to include Oakhost Darwin build capacity.

Details for this and many other SRE work items can be found in the biweekly SRE
reports.

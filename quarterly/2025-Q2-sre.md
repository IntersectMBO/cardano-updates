### Main achievements

In addition to ongoing general maintenance and support of cardano environments,
some highlights of SRE achievements for this quarter include:

* All IOE cardano-parts supported node environments, including preview,
preprod, and mainnet were upgraded through cardano-node releases
including `10.3.1` and `10.4.1` with various additional pre-release versions
tested.

* The cardano performance cluster used for benchmarking was upgraded to
ephemeral instance configuration to additionally benchmark LMDB ledger backend.

* Peer snapshot files (and checkpoint file for mainnet) are now a regular part
of the release binary artifacts in preparation for genesis mode.

* Genesis mode has been rolled out as the default consensus mode for preview
and preprod testnets.

* [Adawallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adawallet) and
[Cardano-airgap](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-airgap) repos received
significant updates to prepare for some complex but infrequent pool operations.

* Aarch64-linux resources were brought online in the Hydra build cluster.


Details for this and many other SRE work items can be found in the biweekly SRE
reports.

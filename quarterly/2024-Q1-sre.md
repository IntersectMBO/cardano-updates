### Main achievements

In addition to ongoing general maintenance and support of cardano environments,
main SRE achievements for this quarter include:

* All cardano release environments, including preview, preprod, mainnet legacy
  and mainnet new clusters were upgraded through cardano-node releases of
  8.7.3, 8.9.0 and finally into 8.9.1 by the end of March

* All cardano pre-release environments, including sanchonet, private chain, and
  shelley-qa clusters were upgraded through cardano-node releases of 8.7.3,
  8.8.0-pre, 8.8.1-pre, 8.9.0 and finally into 8.9.1 by the end of March

* Sanchonet and private chain environments were both re-spun once each during
  this quarter to support new pre-release versions of cardano-node in the Conway era

* Cardano-parts added a cardano-db-sync process-compose stack for each
  environment

* Cardano-parts added a cardano-node process-compose stack for each environment

* Cardano-parts added enhancements for topology related nixos modules and
  functions to accomodate new bootstrapPeer functionality, new topology
  attributes and increased complexity network deployments.

* Cardano-parts added support for mithril signers integrated with block
  producers and a mithril-signer-verifier service for monitoring

* Sanchonet, preview, preprod and mainnet IOG block producers are now signing
  mithril certificates

* Cardano-parts added support for mithril clients in nixos cardano-node systemd
  service, process-compose job stacks and nix cardano-node entrypoint, all of
  which also require any mithril snapshot to be signed by a trusted IOG pool
  prior to use

* Cardano-parts added ip integration tooling, so that similar to other deployer
  tools like nixops, nixosConfigurations possess ip information which can be
  used in module configuration

* Cardano-db-sync snapshots server migration from legacy mainnet cluster to new
  mainnet cluster with a rewrite of the snapshot service was completed

* Cardano metadata server migration to Cardano Foundation was completed

* BlockPerf, a cardano-node performance monitoring tool, was integrated into the
  new mainnet cluster relays

* Cardano-node bootstrapPeer functionality was added with node 8.9.x, requiring
  effort to align nixos service module code between cardano-node nixos
  services, iohk-nix topology generation, cardano-ops legacy code, and
  cardano-parts module compatibility as well as feature test under various edge
  cases

* Cardano-playground added govtool backend support for private chain voltaire
  testing team

### Next steps

* Add support for the new cardano-node metrics system

* Add IPv6 cardano-parts support

* Extend govtool frontend and backend to a process-compose stack

* Adapt network spin-up tooling for the new create-testnet-data cardano-cli command

* Continue cardano-parts and operations improvements

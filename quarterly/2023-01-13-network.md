## Network Quarterly Update
## 2022-11 - 2023-01

### Summary

The primary goal of the networking team was to focus on the single relay
release of P2P.  We fixed a number of small late bugs, and concluded QA
& performance testing.  Although it was discovered a regression in performance
of  block production when P2P is enabled, relaying with P2P performs better
comparing to a non p2p.  We concluded that this is not a blocker for the Single
Relay Release which is planned shortly.

[Peer sharing][pr #4019] has gone through review and final review is
just being done right now.  After merging it will still be disabled (hidden
behind a flag) as it's not safe without eclipse evasion.  We started
implementing light peer sharing (i.e. include inbound peers into known peer set
of the outbound governor).

We started a detailed eclipse evasion design, it will continue in the next
quarter.

Armando Santos delivered a talk at the [ODOPIS 2022] conference on principles
of distributed systems in Brussels.  The slides are available [here][ODOPIS-slides].

Neil Davies gave an invited seminar on `DeltaQ` at Universit√© Catholique de
Louvain.

### Next steps

We will work towards the next release of P2P for block producer nodes.  This includes:

* analysing performance regression for BP nodes when using P2P
* finish the work on controlling the block forger through node kernel ([pr #3800])
* address [issue #3907] and write a script to analyse deployment of P2P relays

We would like also to push forward eclipse evasion.   Although most of the work
has be done already the release of `io-sim` on `Hackage` will happen in the
next quarter.

We would also like to address [chain-sync timeout issue][issue #4244] recently
diagnosed by Karl Knutsson.

If time permits we would also like to address some technical debt, especially:

- [enable nothunk in diffusion tests][issue #3387]
- [refactor diffusion testnet simulation][issue #4085]

### Risks

The performance regression for block producer with P2P needs to be investigated
in the near future.  This is blocker for the release of P2P on BP nodes.

### Detailed log

#### Contributions to Ouroboros-Network

- We added `TraceDemoteLocalAsynchronous`, which enables notification of critical issues for SPOs
- We fixed `cardano-ping` compatibility with `NodeToNodeV_10` (P2P, [pr #4165])
- We fixed a bug in demotion peers to cold which affected P2P nodes ([commit-61058aa5c2])
- Karl Knutsson enhanced `SendFetchRequest` ([commit-bb1c3dddee]), open-source contribution)
- We turned `SizeInBytes` into a newtype.
- We extended `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`.
- We fixed DNS test failure [issue #4191]
- We fixed a simulation bug found in [issue #4258]

#### Contributions to Cardano-Node

- We maintained the Single Relay Release [pr #4612], (e.g. fixing CI issues,
  Rebasing it when necessary, publishing packages to Cardano Haskell Packages);
- We enhanced `JSON` serialisation / deserialisation of `NodeToNodeVersion` and `NodeToClientVersion`;

#### Contributions to IOSim

- We started to use Cardano Haskell Packages for `IOSim` ([pr #48])
- We updated change log files
- We added support of `ghc-9.4` ([pr #50])

We also addressed the following issues in [pr #57] in order to prepare the package for publication on Hackage:

- refactored `io-classes` timers API ([issue #46]);
- created a new package `si-timers` which exposes an interface using SI units
  and is safe on 32-bit systems ([issue #59]);
- added monad transformers instances for classes defined in `io-classes` ([issue #58]);
- created `io-classes-mtl` package which includes (experimental) instances for monad transformers;
- provide `MonadMonotonicTimeNSec` in `io-classes` and `MonadMonotonicTime` in `si-timers` (so that `io-classes` follow the `base` package);
- added  `registerCancellableDelay` in `si-timers` (which allowed us to hide fancy timer api and clean `io-classes`)
- added support for `js_HOST_ARCH` (the new GHC JS backend)

Note the [pr #57] contains almost 40 commits, and was a major step forward for
`io-sim` ecosystem.  We also prepared a draft [pr #4281] which updates
`ouroboros-network`.

Other changes for `1.0.0.0` release on Hackage:

- Refactored test suite ([pr #47])
- Updated documentation, cabal files, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY` documents, etc in [pr #60], currently under review.

### Main achievements

In addition to ongoing general maintenance and support of cardano environments, main SRE achievements for this quarter include:
* Completion of mainnet relay networking conversion to p2p topology
* Cardano sanchonet environment respins for testing new cardano-node pre-release Conway era functionality
* Stabilization of cardano-explorer in cardano-world using high IOPS bare metal machines
* Creation of a nix content addressed packages repository, [capkgs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/capkgs):
  * To provide lightweight release binaries thereby avoiding sluggish nix flakes and devShells
* Creation of a cardano performance benchmarking cluster, [cardano-perf](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-perf):
  * To replace legacy cluster benchmark tooling
* Creation of a cardano cluster composition repository, [cardano-parts](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts):
  * For enabling multi-cluster, multi-role cardano network deployments
* Creation of a cardano testnets repository, [cardano-playground](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-playground):
  * Utilizing cardano-parts for testnet deployments
* Creation of a sanchonet demo repository, [sanchonet-demo](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sanchonet-demo):
  * Utilizing cardano-parts for fast sanchonet test environment and demo purposes

### Next steps

* Continue with migration of cardano-world testnets to cardano-playground
* Proceed with spinup of mainnet p2p bootstrap cluster
* Scale down mainnet non-p2p legacy cluster at the appropriate time

Along that way, we have identified, located and handled all performance blockers.  </p><p>Additionally, we've started publishing benchmarking reports here on Cardano Updates. The format is meant to increase transparency and
provide insight into those measurements that accompany mainnet releases - demonstrating the absence of performance regressions and development
of specific metrics over time.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conway-benchmarks">Conway benchmarks<a class="hash-link" href="#conway-benchmarks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Furthermore, we've done first ever benchmarking of the Conway ledger. To that end, we've ported our Babbage workloads to Conway for
immediate comparability. Fortunately, we've have not found any performance regression in the Conway ledger.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="p2p-benchmarks">P2P benchmarks<a class="hash-link" href="#p2p-benchmarks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In Q4, we've validated P2P topology to be viable as default for both relay and block producer nodes. As a consequence, we've switched
to P2P topology for benchmarking baselines ourselves.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ghc9-performance">GHC9 performance<a class="hash-link" href="#ghc9-performance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In Q4, evaluation of GHC9.2's and GHC9.6's optimizer in the context of the Cardano code base has been completed.
Eventually, GHC9.6 has shown itself to be much more suitable from a performance perspective. We're convinced that
with a few select annotations in the code, GHC9.6's optimizer can produce a result on par performance-wise with GHC8.10 -
which just was a great release in that regard. With GHC9.2 unfortunately, the changes would have to be more invasive - and thus more time-consuming.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-nomad-cluster">New nomad cluster<a class="hash-link" href="#new-nomad-cluster" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We’ve moved the new Nomad cluster into production use and established new baselines for each workload on it.
Additionally, we’ve shut down the legacy <code>cardano-ops</code> benchmarking cluster, and archived all raw data from it.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consensus-component-qtas">Consensus component QTAs<a class="hash-link" href="#consensus-component-qtas" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We’ve developed the existing prototype into an automatable, self-contained benchmark called <code>beacon</code>, as well as systematized workloads and run structure for it.
Moreover, we’ve demonstrated usefulness of the metrics, their reproducibility, and identified domains viable for QTAs with system-level benchmarks.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-team-member">New team member<a class="hash-link" href="#new-team-member" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We're happy to welcome a new joiner to our team! We've successfully onboarded him in Q4; he has taken
over the <code>cardano-tracer</code> service - the node-external component of the new tracing system - and has already
landed several valuable contributions.</p>]]></content>

various rounds of validation and adjustments in Q3 - in addition to finalizing integration with the rest
of our pipeline. The confidence in metrics gathered on the cluster is now sufficient for us to consider it
ready for production use.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-tracing-system">New tracing system<a class="hash-link" href="#new-tracing-system" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Our new tracing system has received various rounds of optimization in Q3. We could verify in our benchmarks that
it is roughly on par with the legacy system while offering a richer feature set and greater flexibility.  </p><p>Additionally, in Q3 we equipped the system with an introspection capability. This is now used for generating
end user documentation that stays in-sync with definitions in code, and for automated consistency checking of the entire system.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ghc9-performance">GHC9 performance<a class="hash-link" href="#ghc9-performance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In Q3, a joint investigation with DevX into GHC9's behaviour revealed where and how GHC9 misses opportunities for

relays on connectivity to <em>big ledger peers</em>.  <em>Big ledger peers</em> are the
largest ledger peers which accumulate 90% of stake (currently there are less
than 1000 of them).  The outbound governor has new targets for <em>known</em>,
<em>established</em> and <em>active</em> big ledger peers which work in a similar way that
such targets work for ledger peers.  The <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ouroboros-network#4662</a> PR is
currently in review.</p><p>As part of this work we also identified a bug which would prevent a node to
connect to itself.  Such connections are not easily detectable and are expected
to be dropped by the churn mechanism, nonetheless they should not be buggy.
The failure was discovered thanks to our e2e simulation of diffusion using
<code>io-sim</code> &amp; property based testing.</p><p>The PR also refactors the heart of the <code>ouroboros-network</code> interface reducing
technical debt that would otherwise accumulate.</p><p>We also identified a possible improvement in the churn mechanism, which will be
implemented in Q3.  Churn needs to await for peers to terminate, we can
improve the synchronisation. <!-- -->[ouroboros-network#4617]</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-p2p-deployment-progress">Ecosystem P2P Deployment Progress<a class="hash-link" href="#ecosystem-p2p-deployment-progress" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We reached <strong>50% of stake in hands of SPOs who run at least on P2P relay</strong>.  Now
also Emurgo and CF are running some P2P relays. Also 20% of IOG relays are
running in P2P mode.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="P2P Progress" src="/assets/images/2023-07-06-p2p-progress-194a909569eebb016b1f24fb8941e2cc.png" width="1024" height="768" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="peer-sharing">Peer Sharing<a class="hash-link" href="#peer-sharing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We implemented <em>bootstrapping for peer sharing</em> (also known as light peer
sharing).  New downstream (inbound) peers are now added to the <em>known peers</em> of
the <em>outbound governor</em>.  Together with peer sharing this allows for non
registered relays to propagate through the network. <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ouroboros-network#3596</a></p><p><em>Please note that peer sharing is disabled by default and is not considered safe

also run by CF &amp; Emurgo).  The feature consists of two parts.  A new source
of peers called <em>bootstrap peers</em> (obtained from via an https request), the
ability to switch from bootstrap peers to ledger peers if the node is synced
(we are collaborating with the consensus team on the interface <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/blob/fbb8c8ee97517809dec0d0c8ae3fae9b8d272caf/docs/website/docs/bootstrap-peers-IER.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap

CIP-1694 received a major update after participation in the design has expanded to
more and more people, including those who attended the Colorado workshop.
See <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP-1694</a>.</li><li><strong>Ledger CIP category</strong> -
The ledger team continues to embrace the CIP process, and has begun the process of
registering the ledger as an official CIP category.
See <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP-84</a>.</li><li><strong>Ledger serialization</strong> -
A CIP for the ledger serialization deprecation cycle has been accepted.

The majority of the ideas in CIP-1694 are now present, and we have made enough progress
that we can now safely say that the PDF produced by the Agda model will be the
official ledger specification for the Conway ledger era.
See <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the repository</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conway-ledger-era">Conway ledger era<a class="hash-link" href="#conway-ledger-era" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Progress on the Haskell implementation of CIP-1694 has gone hand in hand with the formal model.
The major component still missing is the DRep stake distribution, which still presents some
technical challenges.</p><p>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3176</a>]

We do not want the memory used by the node to increase too much,
and performance problems can lead to reduced block production.
We have prototyped, tested, and benchmarked several approaches that could give us
the current DRep stake distribution at each epoch boundary.
This has very important implications, since we want every ADA holder to be able to at any
time (such as during a contentious vote) register themselves as a DRep and still have time
to vote themselves on the issue.</p><p>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3344</a>]

Deposits were returned according to the current protocol parameters.
When the values of these two protocol parameters change, the deposit pot
is adjusted by adding to, or removing from, the reserves.</p><p>This has several problems:</p><ul><li>Most people expect a deposit to be paid back exactly.</li><li>We cannot increase the deposit amount once the reserves hits zero.</li><li>If it becomes known that the deposit amount is going to be increased, free Lovelace can be earned by registering credentials.</li><li>Because of the problems above, it is going to be incredibly hard to ever change the values.</li><li>There is a serious issue involving hard forks.
The consensus layer makes the decision about whether or not to enact a hard fork based on
the protocol parameter update state two stability windows before the end of the epoch.
However, the ledger will reject a protocol parameter update on the epoch boundary
if the deposit pot adjustments cannot be reconciled with the reseve pot.
This means that if quorum is met regarding changing the major protocol version,
but the update is rejected on the epoch boundary, consensus will change the era but the
ledger will not change the major protocol version, leaving the ledger in a split-brain state.</li></ul><p>Because we never actually changed the values of the two deposits amounts in the protocol parameters
on mainnet, we were able to retroactively change the behavior.
We made the following changes:</p><ul><li>Individual deposits are tracked in the <code>DState</code>.</li><li>The amount deposited is always returned.</li></ul><p>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3195</a>]

which span several epochs, mimicking a real network.
These tests are, in theory, excellent for checking properties.
They are, however, very difficult to maintain and are not as random as we would like
(a lot of bias has to be introduced to keep the ledger state in enough order to keep generating blocks).</p><p>We have a new declaritive infrastructure for building constraint-based generators,
which instead generate a random ledger state representative of not just an initial state,
but also those representative of the end result of a long sequence of valid blocks.
Moreover, these generators are very fast and are much more random than our old generators.
Before we can start using them for our existing property tests, however, we still need to
expand them to generate a valid block for a given ledger state.</p><p>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3219</a>]</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-debt">Technical debt<a class="hash-link" href="#technical-debt" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We continued to address technical debt as much as we can.</p><p>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3167</a>]

&amp; performance testing.  Although it was discovered a regression in performance
of  block production when P2P is enabled, relaying with P2P performs better

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-quarterly-update">Open Source Quarterly Update<a class="hash-link" href="#open-source-quarterly-update" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2022-11---2023-01">2022-11 - 2023-01<a class="hash-link" href="#2022-11---2023-01" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the last quarter the open-source initiative delivered a comprehensive report
on the state of our repositories.  As part of this work stream we
identified the key open-source repositories for the cardano project across all
the projects  From a list of more than 500 repositories (some of which are
forks) we identified key repositories which constitute the core of Cardano.
20 of them were identified as to be transferred to the future MBO which will
govern Cardano development.  Some where excluded (like <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>io-sim</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/typed-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>typed-protocols</code></a>), to be govern by IOG, since they have a much broader
application than Cardano itself, and thus we think their open-source future
will be better outside of the Cardano umbrella.</p><p>Christian Taylor identified a number of ways we can improve our repositories to
make them more attractive for open-source contributions by analysing each of
them.  This includes adding or improving various documentation files, like
<code>CONTRIBUTING</code> files, adding code of conduct, improving readme files, issue
&amp; pull request templates etc.  Christian also computed various interesting
metrics which gives a very good insight into the development practices: e.g.
average merge ratio, average number of reviews, comments and many more!  The
presentation is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/127IFEavlrZeeoFrVXFYWzSt0ugOkSL7isxjyM1vmMzQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>We followed with work on the <a href="https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-engineering-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardano Engineering Handbook</a>.  We included
a standard code of conduct which is now used by most important projects in the
Cardano space.  We included <code>cardano-node</code>'s security policy and added
a responsible disclosure policy.  We also described how roles and
responsibilities should be clarified.  This progress was made by
a collaborative effort of the Cardano Core, Plutus and Architecture teams, and
it wouldn't be possible without Michael Peyton Jones, Arnaud Bailly, Kevin
Hammond, Jared Corduan and Marcin Szamotulski.</p><p>We also improved the documentation of key repositories, by adding description,
improving their <code>README</code> file &amp; <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> files, adding code of conducts
following the <a href="https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-engineering-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardano Engineering Handbook</a>.  This includes improvements to:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ouroboros-network</code></a> (both <code>network</code> &amp; <code>consensus</code>)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>cardano-ledger</code></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>cardano-node</code></a></li></ul><p>And also</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>io-sim</code></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/typed-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>typed-protocols</code></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-prelude" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>cardano-prelude</code></a> (work in progress)</li></ul><p>The work was carried by Marcin Szamotulski, Addie Girouard and  Jared Corduan. </p><p>In this quarter we also identified a number of projects which can be published to
<code>Hackage</code> (Haskell's package repository) or <code>crate</code> (Rust package repository).
The list contains 21 packages, 2 of which (<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog-extras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>hedgehog-extras</code></a> and
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-dynamic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>quickcheck-dynamic</code></a>) are already published on Hackage and another 5 (from
the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>io-sim</code></a> repository) are close to be published.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="detailed-log">Detailed log<a class="hash-link" href="#detailed-log" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The progress of the open-source project is tracked in <a href="https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/60/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this project</a>.</p>]]></content>

(<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pr #3690</a> - merged).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="detailed-log">Detailed log<a class="hash-link" href="#detailed-log" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>We expanded diffusion simulation with block-fetch protocol bringing it closer
to the production system.</p></li><li><p>We addressed some additional technical depth in diffusion simulation</p></li><li><p>We slightly improved documentation &amp; CI of io-sim and typed-protocols
repositories for open-source contributors.</p></li><li><p>We closed a number of issues towards publishing io-sim on Hackage (only two
essential issues are left open).</p></li><li><p>We pushed a branch of typed-protocols which captures one of the developer UX
problems in the API which we need to solve.</p></li><li><p>We identified and fixed an issue related to systemd sockets.</p></li><li><p>We identified and fixed an issue in consensus initialisation not giving
feedback on early errors.</p></li><li><p>We deployed RT View, identified a number of issues which were communicated to
the performance &amp; monitoring team.</p></li><li><p>We finished high level &amp; detailed design of peer sharing, very early
implementation of peer sharing is done (note that peer sharing cannot be
safely deployed without eclipse evasion &amp; genesis).</p></li><li><p>We finished high level design of eclipse evasion, and started working on
a detailed design.</p></li><li><p>We were assigned the role of release engineer for 1.35.5 release (the P2P
single relay release); we prepared a cardano-node for 1.35.5 release which
contains more than 130 patches of just network stack improvements done over
last few months.</p></li><li><p>We diagnosed and fixed an tricky bug in the peer state actions (a component
which sits between outbound governor and connection manager). That bug was
introduced earlier this year and never released. It was caught by the QA
testing framework. We expanded our diffusion simulation to cover such case and
also mitigated a chance for reintroducing such a bug in future.</p></li><li><p>We identified and quite likely mitigated a misconfiguration in the
benchmarking cluster (next benchmarking run will confirm our hypothesis).</p></li><li><p>We simplified the format of p2p topology file, we got positive feedback from
SPOs.</p></li><li><p>We raised severities of some of the logging messages, which is an important
improvement for SPOs, exchanges and other users of the system.</p></li><li><p>We worked on input endorsers simulation which gives both animated and
quantified live feedback on network operation, using a simplified model of
a TCP/IP network. </p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-quarter">Next quarter<a class="hash-link" href="#next-quarter" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Release the Single Relay P2P Release <code>1.35.5</code>.</p></li><li><p>Carry on with Peer Sharing (review, testing).</p></li><li><p>Deliver a talk at <a href="https://sites.uclouvain.be/OPODIS2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conference on Principles of Distributed Systems 2022</a> in Brussels, Belgium.</p></li><li><p>Present Detailed Design of Eclipse Evasion and start implementation phase.</p></li><li><p>Work on P2P Block Producer release.</p></li><li><p>Carry on with publishing of <code>io-sim</code> on <code>Hackage</code>.</p></li></ul>]]></content>

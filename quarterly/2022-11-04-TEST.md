## High level summary

This week, the hydra team first re-deployed the latest Hydra scripts to the re-spun `preview` network, see [0.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/releases/tag/0.8.0). They also completed implementation of [ADR18](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/adr/18/) and worked on the validators, but development got impacted by some CI flakyness. The team also met to discuss hard forks & protocol parameter updates [#195](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/issues/195#issuecomment-1300503557) and alignment of the specification document with auditors.

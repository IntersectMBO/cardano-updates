## 2025-10 - 2025-12

### Main achievements

In addition to ongoing general maintenance and support of cardano environments,
some highlights of SRE achievements for this quarter include:

* All IOE cardano-parts supported node environments, including preview,
  preprod, and mainnet were upgraded to cardano-node release `10.5.2` and then
  `10.5.3` with various additional pre-release versions tested, such as
  `10.6.1`.

* Support for generating arm64 release binaries and OCI images was merged to
  master with the expectation that cardano-node version `10.6.2` and greater will
  have these artifacts available.  A cardano-tracer OCI container has also been
  added.

* The IOE SRE team helped support a successful rollout of the Glacier Drop and
  Scavenger hunt operational phases of Midnight.

Details for this and many other SRE work items can be found in the biweekly SRE
reports.

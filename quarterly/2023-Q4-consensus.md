## Highlights

### Implement legacy mode for UTxO-HD to keep baseline performance

- âœ… We managed to run a UTxO-HD capable node in legacy mode, maintaining the baseline memory usage while keeping all the ledger state in memory.
    - While the legacy mode is not production-ready (it requires further integration and testing), it remains as a plan B should the need arise to release UTxO-HD if our stakeholders so demand it.
- âœ… We pivoted to redesigning the Ledger DB API because:
    - This is needed for integrating the LSM-tree backend.
	- The redesign opened the possibility of implementing an in-memory backend that would keep the same performance and resource requirements as the baseline version (which needs to be confirmed by benchmarks).
- âœ… We created a more general Ledger DB API.
- ðŸš§ We are integrating (into the feature branch) the existing Ledger DB implementations with the new API.
- ðŸš§ We are implementing the new in-memory backend.

### Assist mainnet node release with initial Conway capabilities

- High-level highlight 1
- ...

### Assist with test, benchmark, and improvements to CIP 1694

(We could merge this section with the one above)

- High-level highlight 1
- ...

### Assist with P2P IOG relay network shut down

### Assist with repo transfer to Intersect

### Support vendors to deliver contracts

- TODO: highlight collaboration between Tweag, Nick and Alex
- ðŸ’¾ LSM-tree implementation. Well Typed:
  - âœ… Finished the design of the public facing API.
  - âœ… Defined the LSM-tree database file-type formats.
  - âœ… Implemented property and model-based tests.

### Operation serenity Q4 2023

- ...
- We added a test to check Consensus emits valid CBOR, which prevents the generation of invalid binary encoding.
- We established and implemented an interface between Consensus tooling and P&T tooling, which constitutes a step towards incorporating component level benchmarks in our development process.

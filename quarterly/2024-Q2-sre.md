### Main achievements

In addition to ongoing general maintenance and support of cardano environments,
main SRE achievements for this quarter include:

* All cardano release environments, including preview, preprod, mainnet legacy
  and mainnet new clusters were upgraded through various cardano-node releases of
  `8.9.2`, `8.9.3`, `8.9.4`, `8.12.1`, and finally into `8.12.2` by the end of
  June

* Cardano pre-release environments additionally iterated through pre-release
  upgrades of `8.11.0-pre`, `8.12.0-pre`, and finally into `8.12.2` by the end
  of June with the exception of sanchonet which remains pinned at `8.11.0-pre`
  until the next respin to support node version `9.0.0` or greater

* Sanchonet environment was re-spun two times for pre-release Conway testing of
  cardano-node versions `8.10.0-pre` and `8.11.0-pre` respectively

* Private chain environment was re-spun three times to support fast epoch
  Conway testing

* Cardano-playground and cardano-mainnet repos have added ten operations
  oriented documents for knowledge transfer

* Block producers which participate in mithril signing will now produce metrics
  and can have them scraped with the default metrics agent

* A cluster spin-up job to utilize the new cardano-cli `create-testnet-data`
  sub-command was created

* A nixosModule, dashboards and alerts were added supporting the new cardano
  tracing system

* Many new operations scripts and features were added, including a template
  diff and patch recipe to pull the latest cardano-parts improvements to
  consuming repositories more easily

### Next steps

* Finalize support for the new cardano-node tracing system once the service is
  rewritten for general consumption

* Add IPv6 cardano-parts support

* Extend govtool frontend and backend to a process-compose stack once govtool
  is publicly buildable again

* Continue cardano-parts and operations improvements

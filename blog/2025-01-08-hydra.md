### High-level summary

Returning from a well-earned break the team has merged the major part of the
work on incremental commits and is now seeking feedback from the community on
this feature. We continue to work on the final changes (in the spec) and
continue testing the feature ourselves. We carry on with our work on the
hydra-explorer and custom ledger investigations, as wel as getting into some
planning for the new year.

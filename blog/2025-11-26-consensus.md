## High level summary

- Participated in the November 2025 incident response, providing analysis on potential intervention scenarios and tracking chain progression metrics.
- Merged documentation of the Leios Protocol Burst attack threat model ([ouroboros-leios#624](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/pull/624)), strengthening the protocol's security foundation ahead of load testing and mitigation strategy development.
- Continued preparation for the Leios November demo, with significant progress on observability infrastructure using Grafana and Prometheus ([#1766](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/issues/1766)), and demo packaging to streamline deployment ([#1759](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/issues/1759)). Both tasks are expected to be completed by end of week.

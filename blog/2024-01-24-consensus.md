## High level summary

This week the team continued working on the second iteration of the Ledger DB API for UTxO-HD, as well as on Genesis.
We incorporated further improvements to the [onboarding documentation](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/pull/879), and [wrote a document](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/pull/891) explaining a specific subtlety of our chain orders.
For Conway, we integrated [DReps and initial delegates injection](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/pull/894), which will allow the Performance and Tracing team to run benchmarks for this era.

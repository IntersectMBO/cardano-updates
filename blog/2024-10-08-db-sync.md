## High level summary
The DBSync team has fixed issues of the latest release, related to offchain data, wrong `pool_stat`
fields, invalidated votes. We also added a requested feauture, which optionally adds a new `address`
table, separating the address from the `tx_out` table. Finally we worked with the ledger team for
memory improvements and introducing ledger events for DBSync.

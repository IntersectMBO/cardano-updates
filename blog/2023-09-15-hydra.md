## High-level summary

This week, most of the Hydra team was attending a cardano scaling workshop in
Nantes, France. They used this oportunity to meet fellow mithril team and spend
some time together to hack on some code and, as always, reflect on the past
work and find optimal path forward for both projects. They also fixed bug that
caused hydra-node to crash when querying L1, proposed new network resillience
POC and accepted a new ADR related to stateless transaction observation.

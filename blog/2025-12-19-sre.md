* This PR improves support for multiple arches in the following ways:

  1) Adds aarch64-linux nix packages, including musl static and OCI tarball generation
     package variants;

  2) Bumps GHC from `9.6.6 -> 9.6.7` as well as the cardano-automation flake
     input for aarch64-linux support;

  3) Updates the release-ghcr GHA workflow to produce linux multi-arch manifest
     OCI and corresponding release images which auto-resolve on container pull to
     the appropriate arch (amd64 or arm64);

  4) Updates the release-upload GHA workflow to produce new linux and darwin
     aarch64 artifacts. Produces new OCI/goarch standard name aligned default OCI
     images.

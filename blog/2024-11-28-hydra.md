### High-level summary

These last few weeks continue on as before; almost wrapping up the incremental
commit work. We are focusing on tests and soon the spec changes, which will be
the last parts. We have integrated the core functionality into the TUI
already, and also added a new requested feature around filtering by UTxO
addresses to the websocket API. We continue on with the custom ledger
experiments and wrapping up incremental commits, as well enhancing the
hydra-explorer and supporting the upcoming Hydra Doom tournament!

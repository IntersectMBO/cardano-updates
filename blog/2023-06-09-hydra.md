## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team worked on multiple fronts. They finished the
investigation about the broken head on mainnet and re-opened their persistent
head instance. The team also fixed the monthly report publication on their
website and started sketching ideas and further improvements. Also, they are on
the last mile to deliver a new feature which will allow parties to commit funds
from extern wallets. Finally the team started to work on optimizing the
performance on their benchmarks.

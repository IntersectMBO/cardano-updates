## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra had a team workshop and conducted the monthly review
meeting for March. They demonstrated a Hydra Head on mainnet, which was running
the hydraw demo application. While this marks an important milestone, they also
emphasized that more features are still to be added as needed for applications
to run on Hydra. Besides this, the roadmap is getting cleaned up to encourage
discussions and provide more space for user requests.

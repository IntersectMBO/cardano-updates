## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the pre-release version of the `2517.0-pre` distribution. This version supports Cardano node v.10.3.1 and allows for signing ancillary files in the Cardano database snapshots using an IOG key. It also includes various bug fixes and improvements. The team continued implementing incremental certification for the Cardano database, also known as Cardano node database v2, which has been activated on the `release-preprod` test network.

They finalized the proof of concept for the Mithril/ALBA aggregation proof system. They also completed the simplification of the aggregatorâ€™s command configuration and dependency injection. Additionally, they implemented a publisher abstraction for the publication of the signatures in the signer.

Finally, the team worked on accelerating the compilation time of the Rust nodes and libraries, and kept refactoring the STM cryptographic library to improve clarity.

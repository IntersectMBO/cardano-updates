## High-level overview of [sprint 44][sprint-44]

### Bootstrap Peers

In this sprint, we focused on developing bootstrap peers.

Thanks to the input from Samuel Leathers (IOG) and John Lotoski (IOG), we
identified a possible improvement to bootstrap peers. A more detailed
description is available [here][ouroboros-network-#4675].

### Cardano-Node-8.4.0 Release

We also were responsible for the `cardano-node-8.4.0-pre` release.  A final
integration [PR][cardano-node-#5467] is currently being merged. We published
new versions of `ouroboros-consensus`, `cardano-api` and `cardano-cli`.

### Towards Typed Protocols 0.2.0.0

We also updated the future `typed-protocols-0.2.0.0` and its integration with
`cardano-node`.  This is towards our goal which we planned for the next
quarter.  The identified tasks are to fix breaking tests, and then measure and
address possible performance regressions.

### Tech Debt

Mark Tullsen (Galois) submitted two more PRs: [ouroboros-network-#4663],
[ouroboros-network-#4664].  We provided feedback on their other pull requests: [ouroboros-network-#4661] and 
[ouroboros-network-#4660].

### P2P adoption

In the last two weeks, there was a regression in P2P adoption concerning
the number of SPOs or stakes, although the number of overall P2P relays has
increased.  Karl Knutsson ([Cardano Foundation][CF]) is investigating 
this issue.

The following graphs show several different versions of relays running on the mainnet.  The
green line `NodeToNodeVersionV10.True` denotes P2P relays, which slowly
increase over time.  The `V9` and earlier versions of the `node-to-node`
the protocol indicates nodes version `1.35.x` or earlier.

Data has been kindly provided by [Cardano Foundation][CF] and their mainnet
monitoring infrastructure.

### Open Source

We are in the process of upstreaming our ffi to Windows Named Pipes API to the `Win32` package, see [win32-220].

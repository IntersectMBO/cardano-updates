* SRE is collaborating with IT Sec team to further harden our infra and
clusters.


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Cardano-parts
* Sets node release to `10.4.1`, cardano-cli release to `10.8.0.0` and mithril to
  `v2517.1`. Adds mithril ancillary key support for signed volatile and ledger
  state. Switches to a blockPerf fork which can be used without publishing
  metrics to CF, ex: for testnet usage. Includes additional misc fixes and
  improvements described in the PR/release header.

### Cardano-mainnet
* Sets node release to `10.4.1`, cardano-cli release to `10.8.0.0` and mithril
  release `v2517.1`. Includes various improvements with cardano-parts release
  `v2025-05-22`.  Deploys all machines to `10.4.1`.

### Cardano-node
* Bumps iohkNix for `10.5` network param changes, preview/preprod default
  GenesisMode consensus config, per env useLedgerAfter and peer-snapshot
  updates. Updates CI for the iohkNix config changes. In the cardano-node nixos
  service, sets preview and preprod environments to use peer-snapshots. Enables
  genesis mode to work OOTB for preview/preprod on: docker images, binary
  artifacts, nixos built machines.

### Cardano-playground
* Sets node release to `10.4.1`, cardano-cli release to `10.8.0.0` and mithril
  release `v2517.1`. Deploys blockPerf to all testnet machines without publishing
  metrics to CF. Includes various improvements with cardano-parts release
  v2025-05-22.  Deploys all machines to `10.4.1`.

### Iohk-nix
* Adds mithril network ancillary verification keys: the ancillary verification
  keys are a breaking change required to pull ancillary mithril state (ie: ledger
  and volatile state) in addition to immutable state. In earlier mithril
  releases, the ancillary state was bundled together with the immutable state.
  [iohk-nix-pr-598](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/pull/598)

* Node `10.5` updates: set `GenesisMode` for `ConsensusMode` as default on
  preview and preprod; tunes `TargetNumberOfEstablishedPeers`, and
  `SyncTargetNumberOfEstablishedBigLedgerPeers` per network team request; updates
  peer-snapshots per environment; updates `useLedgerAfterSlot` per environment.

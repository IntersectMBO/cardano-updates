### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team fixed a bug in the smoke test and refactored to allow network functions to distinguish between inbound and outbound. The team also prepared a cardano-api 8.44 branch for cardano-node 8.10 once it gets released. They also contributed to the `cardano-ledger-api` by undeprecating and exposing `redeemerPointer`.

## High level summary

Ability to specify `CostModel` for `PlutusV3` in the genesis file was implemented, which
will allow us to execute `PlutusV3` as soon as we enter `Conway` era, which is essential
for guardrails script. Important bugs that have been fixed:

* Invalid reporting of `InsufficientCollateral` and `ValueNotConservedUTxO` predicate
  failures. In case of validation failure a confusing deserialization was reported instead
  of those predicate failures.
* Calculation of votes for Constitutional Committee Members did not consider expired
  members correctly.
* Useful function `redeemerPointer` was deprecated without good justification.

Besides bugfixes there was a lot of work done on the testing side. Constraint based data
generation is receiving continuous improvements. More unit and property tests for Conway
era functionality.

## Low level summary

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept implementing a new data type for certifying Cardano transactions within Mithril networks. They completed the aggregator routes responsible for generating proofs of membership for a list of Cardano transactions, and for listing produced artifacts. Additionally, they worked on extending the Mithril client library to support the verification of Cardano transactions. The team also worked on the creation of the new Mithril network running on Sanchonet.

Finally, they kept working on the threat modeling and risk analysis for the Mithril network and investigated some flakiness occuring on the end-to-end tests in the CI.

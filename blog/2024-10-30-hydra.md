### High-level summary

This last few weeks have seen us spend some time in internal planning, focus
hard on incremental commits. We've made good progress on the on-chain
validators and associated tests; we continue on with this work. We are also
beginning to tackle partial fanout by making some small steps based on the
ongoing work of [Thomas](https://github.com/perturbing/plutus-accumulator) and
others.

## System Test Update

We have been focused on:

* Fully opening our test results (on top of the existing tests & tools):  
  See [cardano-node-tests webpage](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node-tests/).
* Started to test and automate the new functionalities added in the `1.35.4-rc1` node tag  
  See [test results tracking page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-tests/blob/tag_test_1.35.4_rc1/src_docs/source/test_results/node/tag_1_35_4_rc1.rst).
* Made some improvements to the automated db-sync sync tests  
  See [db-sync tests](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-tests/tree/db_sync_tests/db_sync_tests).
* Multiple cleanups and updates to the cardano-node-tests framework
* Updated the nightly pipelines for the cardano-node-tests after the Babbage HF

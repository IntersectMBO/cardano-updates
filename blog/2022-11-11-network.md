## High-level summary

In last sprint we got a performance report of P2P performance testing cluster
(which consists of 50 nodes).  There is a performance regression in the header
notification metric.  The P2P cluster is constructed with the same
topology as the non-p2p reference one this indicates some regression which
needs to be further investigated.  This poses a risk for releasing P2P.

We also continued to work on peer sharing: [pull #4019].

We continued working on dynamic block production which is required for P2P
release for BP nodes: [pull #3159].

We simplified the P2P topology format: [issue #4559], [pull #3888].

We added a new trace point for asynchronous demotions of local peers with
`Warning` severity.  This trace is **important** for SPOs.

## Detail description

### Performance regression

Below we include a graph which shows the performance regression of the P2P code base vs non P2P.

<img src={NoticedHeaders} />

On the `x` axis is time in seconds which measures the delay from the start of
the slot to when a header was received. The `y` axis is the percentile of nodes
that received a header.  We are currently investigating possible causes of the
regression. 

### New P2P topology form

The new topology file format is described in this [issue #4559].

### Tracing improvements

* We improved a handshake error reporting, [pull #4136]
* We added `TraceDemoteLocalAsynchronous` rendered as `DemoteLocalAsynchronous`
  in `json` format, [pull #4127].  Such demotions should be investigated by the
  pool operator.  They can indicate a problem in the deployed system, but also
  they could indicate a remote problem in arranged connections with other SPOs.

### Open Source Improvements

We improved documentation of `io-sim` and `typed-protocols` for open-source
contributors and/or maintenance tasks: [pull #22], [pull #45], [pull #48].

## Overview of sprint [93][sprint-93]


### Tx-Submission

We deployed our `tx-submission` work (see [Issue#3311] based on
the `cardano-node-10.5` release.  The node has been working without any problems.  

### Mithril

We prepared two PR which will allow us to capture raw bytes alongside decoded
data structures.  This is essential for checking signatures as well as avoiding
re-serialisation of signed data:

* [**AnnotatedCodec** (typed-protocols)][PR#74]
* [**Annotated decoded for TxSubmission mini-protocol**][PR#4934] 

These PRs are in review.

We now have a `dmq` node with the following capabilities:

* can disiminate signatures, but not validate them in any way, although one
  cannot submit signatures (/work in progress/)
* discover peers (with `peer-sharing` mini-protocol)
* control connections through `keep-alive` mini-protocol
* configuration file which allows setting diffusion options, setting up traces, etc. 
* basic logging system

In the current state of development, we were able to connect two `dmq` nodes
and observe keep-alive messages.  In the next stage, we will be able to submit
signatures and observe how they are diffused through a network of `dmq` nodes.

### Connection Duration

We added a trace point which allows one to see how long a connection lived, see [PR#5146].

### Release of `ouroboros-network-0.22.1`

We released `ouroboros-network-0.22.1`.  It is already integrated with
`ouroboros-consensus` and it will be included in `cardano-node-10.6`. See [release-board].

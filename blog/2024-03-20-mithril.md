## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks: they kept working on scaling the signature and proof generation for `mainnet`, completed the UI improvements of the explorer, provided metadata about the point of the chain used during the verification process, and investigated a bug in the blocks parser that prevents some Conway transactions to be signed. Additionally, they have started prototyping the implementation of a more versatile beaconing mechanism that will be used to sign transactions with low latency.

Finally, the team started implementing some community requested feature to the output folder structure verifications made by the client, and fixed a source of flakiness in the end-to-end test in the CI.

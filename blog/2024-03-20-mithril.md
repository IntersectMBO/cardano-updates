## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They focused on scaling the signature and proof generation for `mainnet`, completed UI improvements for the explorer, provided metadata about the point of the chain used during the verification process, and investigated a bug in the block parser that prevents some Conway transactions from being signed. Additionally, they began prototyping the implementation of a more versatile beaconing mechanism to sign transactions with low latency.

Finally, the team started implementing some community-requested features to verify the output folder structure made by the client, and fixed a source of flakiness in the CI end-to-end test.

## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra continued work on finishing mainnet compatibility. The
semi-automated smoke tests and some missing documentation is still preventing
from calling that fully done. They fixed smaller issues and made a step in the
Head protocol more robust. Besides development, they met with interested people
from the community who want to get started collaborating on communication and
marketing materials.

## What did the team achieve this week

-   Groomed and followed-up on `GetUTxO` user request discussion [#797](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/797)
-   Fixed `hydra-node` crashes after forks [#560](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/560)
-   Made `collectCom` more robust and aligned with spec [#786](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/786)
-   Completed configurable API feature [#380](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/380)
-   Met potential contributors about Hydra communication and marketing materials
-   Versioned documentation: we have a `unstable` bleeding edge version available as well now, seperate from the last released version

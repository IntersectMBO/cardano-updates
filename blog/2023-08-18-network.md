## High-level overview of [sprint 42][sprint-42]

### Eclipse Evasion

We merged and released a new version of the `ouroboros-network` package (version
`0.9.0.0`) which includes [big ledger peers feature][ouroboros-network#3886].
This is the primary peer selection mechanism to defend against eclipses.   We
also prepared a PR to updated [`ouroboros-cosnensus`][ouroboros-consensus#165]
and [`ekg-forward`][ekg-forward#30] packages.

### CDDL specs for protocol codecs

We made the `cddl` spec for network codec more inline with the implementation
which is highly polymorphic.  `cddl` doesn't have the notion of polymorphism,
but has `any` which can generate any valid cbor term.  We matched it with an
`Any` type on the Haskell side and made all remaining tests & specs use it.
This simplified the specifications and made it easier to understand which parts
are defined in the spec, and which parts are left unspecified.  See
[ouroboros-network#4595].

### Ouroboros-Network-Framework API changes

We also released `ouroboros-network-framework` and other network components.
The `ouroboros-network-framework` package contains a redesign of API exposed to
`ouroboros-consensus`.  We consolidated, cleaned it and made it easier to
extend in the future if there will be new arguments that need to be passed to
mini-protocol initiator and responders which comes from the low-level network
layer.

### Nix setup (CI)

We also made a major review of our `nix` setup.  With help from our DevX team
we ended up with a clean `flake.nix` file which can:

* compile & test the code on `x86_64-linux`, `x86_64-darwin` and `aarch64-darwin`
* cross-compile to `Windows` on `x86_64-linux` 

And provides a shell which contains all the build tools, including `ghc-9.6`,
`hls`, `cddl`, and more.  See [ouroboros-network#4640],
[ouroboros-network#4643].


## Other contributions

### Cardano Network Service Assurance

* The work and writeup in finishing up the CNSA, first stage (first
  contract).
* Getting Sam Cowger (Galois Inc) up to speed.
* The IOG Networking team carried a reivew of CNSA project progress: a limitted
  code & design review.

### Galois Review

Sam Cowger and Mark Tullsen (Galois Inc) have made some progress on each of the tech debt issues

* [ouroboros-network#3832],
* [ouroboros-network#3834],
* [ouroboros-network#3835],
* [ouroboros-network#3836];

scoping, requirements, and getting started.

### CI

We added a nightly run for GitHub actions and made the GitHub actions test be
executed with extra concurrency [ouroboros-network#4637], [ouroboros-network#4649].

We also added GitHub's dependabot [ouroboros-network#4650].

### Bootstrap Peers

We settled on implementation design of bootstrap peers which is being
implemented, [ouroboros-network#4615].

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team completed the adaptation of the Mithril client as a library. They progressed in decentralizing the Mithril networks with the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking proof-of-concept, achieving the implementation of P2P signatures broadcast with the relay in the end-to-end tests. Additionally, the team completed the proof-of-concept for the deterministic computation of the UTXO/transactions set from the immutable files.

Finally, they continued addressing some performance issue associated with the 'release-mainnet' aggregator, and fixed a bug with the tool used to process batch certificate hash re-computation.

## High level summary

Major Conway related development was the refactoring of how we distinguish Plutus
language versions in every era, thus drasticly improving the type safety and getting us
much closer to PlutusV3 integration.

There has also been many bug fixes and improvements since the last update. Some important bug
fixes are:

* missing `"protocolVersion"` field in JSON instance for Babbage and Conway protocol parameters
* requiring witnesses for DRep registration
* new committee governance action ratification was implemented incorrectly
* guard against invalid protocol versions in hard fork initiation proposals
* failures during updates of Plutus CostModels were not retained
* fixed the types for some protocol parameters in order to prevent values that are too large
* serialization and CDDL fixes

A few useful features have been also implemented, like new ledger events, doubling the
limit for Url length, consensus query, JSON instances and so on. It was also required
for testing to implement a reliable transaction fee estimation function, which is now
available not only for testing, but also for cardano-cli.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team prepared the pre-release for the `2543.0-pre` distribution. This version introduces support for the default incremental backend (v2) for Cardano database restoration, enhanced integrity verification that reports any tampered or missing files in case of failure, and various bug fixes and improvements.

The team also completed the integration of the Haskell DMQ node into the end-to-end tests to enable decentralized signature diffusion. They implemented a simple aggregator discovery mechanism and continued work on the first phase of decentralizing configuration parameters. Additionally, they advanced the design of certificate snarkification.

Finally, they adapted the project to the latest NPM security changes for publishing packages and refactored the aggregator's HTTP client.

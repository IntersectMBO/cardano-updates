## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team created the pre-release for the `2543.0-pre` distribution, which provides support for the default incremental backend (v2) for Cardano database restoration, enhanced verification for Cardano database integrity, providing a list of tampered or missing files in case of failure, and includes various bug fixes and improvements.

They completed the integration of the Haskell DMQ node in the end-to-end tests to support decentralized signature diffusion. They also worked on implementing a simple aggregator discovery mechanism and continued implementing the first phase of decentralizing the configuration parameters. Additionally, they kept working on the design of the snarkification of the certificates.

Finally, they worked on adapting to the security changes for NPM package publication and refactoring the aggregator HTTP client.

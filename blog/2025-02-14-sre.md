## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* IoE Sanchonet pools and community bootstrap relays are being terminated as
Sanchonet has fulfilled its purpose.  The community will carry Sanchonet
forward a little longer for an environment to run some community workshops
organized by Mike Hornan.

* Cardano-node container image improvement work is in progress.  The node PR listed
as WIP below will be additionally followed up by another in the near future to
support the new cardano-node tracing system.

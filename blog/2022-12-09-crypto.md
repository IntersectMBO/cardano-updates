## High level summary
The four open fronts that the crypto team is working on are:
* MuSig2: We were blocked with a CI issue, that we finally resolved. Similarly, we merged the redesig of the API to mantain consistency. 
* Mithril: Merged the reformat of the signle signature. Similarly, we started working in ensuring KES implementation in rust is safe. 
* cardano-base: VRF and BLS are still waiting to be merged, as we have some problems with the CI. Moreover, we started experimenting how rust can be included in the cardano-base code-stack. 
* KES agent: We keep progressing with KES secure forgetting implementation as well as the KES agent.

## Low level summary
### MuSig2
* [Still in progress] We are introducing a more granular error handling mechanism [PR#33](https://github.com/input-output-hk/musig2/pull/33)
* We merged the API redesig [PR#35](https://github.com/input-output-hk/musig2/pull/35)
* We were blocked for a while with a CI issue, for which we are currently simply using a simpler version of Ubuntu. We'll probably circle back to this in the future [PR#36](https://github.com/input-output-hk/musig2/pull/36)

### Mithril
* We merged the individual signature [PR#620](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/620)
* We are modifying important parts of the KES mplementation to guarantee there are no unnecessary copies during Ser/Deser ([kes repo](https://github.com/input-output-hk/kes/commits/master)) 

### cardano-base
* Nothing new to report. Still working in merging these PRs. 
* We started experimenting on how we can use cabal-pack to create haskell libraries out of rust libraries, and how this would affect the cardano-base fork. We encountered what seems to be a [bug in GHC](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22564)

## KES agent
* We keep progressing in the secure forgetting PR and resolving some bugs on memory handling [PR#255](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/255)
* Fixed a 'use-after-free' bug in the KES agent.

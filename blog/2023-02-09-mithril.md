## High level overview
The Mithril team released a new [`2304.1`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2304.1) distribution that enables the backward/forward compatibility mechanism implemented for seamlessly rolling out soft updates to  Mithril networks. They completed the implementation of the era reader trait that powers the era switch behavior. The team finalized the development of the era reader adapter that retrieves era activation markers from transactions on the Cardano chain. They also completed the relational design of the aggregator store.

Finally, they created new SPO nodes on the Mithril networks and upgraded the Cardano node to version `1.35.5` on their `devnet` and infrastructure.

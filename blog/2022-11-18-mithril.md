## High level overview
The Mithril team has released their second distribution 2246.1 following the activation of the alpha version of the new release process. They continued refining its implementation and added a new set of artifacts to the distributions, such as Debian packages and macOS/Windows binaries. The team also enhanced the Mithril Explorer, which now provides more detailed information about epoch settings and easier access to multiple aggregators for the users. They have also worked on an enhanced mechanism for node versioning, storage, and communication protocol. They also implemented version detections for the signer and aggregator nodes, designed the automatic store upgrade feature for these nodes, and enhanced the documentation of the configuration parameters of the several Mithril networks. 

Finally, the team continued working on the elaboration of the CIP that will allow the decentralization of Mithril by relying on the Cardano node network layer.

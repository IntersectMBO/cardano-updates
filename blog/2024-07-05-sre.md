## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on cardano environment improvements and general
environment maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:
* Cardano-node `9.0.0` is now deployed to mainnet, preprod, preview, private and
  shelley-qa environments.  The last several weeks have been very busy with
  pre-release and release activity and environment upgrades involving
  cardano-node versions `8.9.3`, `8.9.4`, `8.12.0-pre`, `8.12.1`, `8.12.2` and
  now `9.0.0` as of this update.

* Sanchonet environment remains pinned at cardano-node version `8.11.0-pre` until
  the next respin which will support `9.0.0` or greater.

* Ogmios service and package options were added to cardano-parts.

* Four documents were added to cardano-playground to better explain some
  operations procedures: debugging of peer-to-peer connections; governance
  voting with the playground stakepools; faucet setup; faucet pool
  de-delegation. Found at:
  [docs/explain](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-playground/tree/main/docs/explain)

* One document was added to cardano-mainnet to explain cardano-snapshot
  operations.  Found at:
  [docs/explain](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-mainnet/tree/main/docs/explain)

* Private chain was stopped and re-spun with 2 hr epochs for testing.

* Hydra and performance cluster machines had their configuration updated to be
  more robust to transient nix store caches outages which may re-occur in the
  future.

* All machines in cardano-playground and cardano-mainnet clusters were updated
  to nixpkgs `24.05`.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released a new one line installer for the pre-built Mithril binaries which will facilitate, in particular, the update process of the signers for the SPOs, and they released a protocol [Security](https://mithril.network/doc/mithril/mithril-protocol/security) page on the documentation website. They also started working on the implementation of a new type of certification for the Cardano database which will allow differential update: a new signed entity type has been scaffolded and the computation of the message to sign is in progress. Additionally, the team completed the adaptation of the WASM client npm package to support NodeJS and started to work on the cache for certificate verification in the WASM client.

Finally, they refactored the legacy store adapters which have been completely removed from the codebase, and explored solutions for signer registration when multiple aggregators are running on a Mithril network.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released a new one-line installer for the pre-built Mithril binaries, simplifying the update process for SPO signers. They also published an overview of the protocol [security](https://mithril.network/doc/mithril/mithril-protocol/security) on the documentation website. The team began implementing a new type of certification for the Cardano database to enable differential updates, scaffolding a new signed entity type, and progressing on the computation of the message to sign.  Additionally, they adapted the WASM client npm package to support NodeJS and started working on a cache for certificate verification in the WASM client. 

Finally, the team completed the removal of legacy store adapters from the codebase and explored solutions for signer registration in networks with multiple aggregators.

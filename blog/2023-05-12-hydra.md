## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team achieved a number of milestones, including the release
of the first mainnet compatible version. Besides this they also addressed
inconsistencies in rollback handling, added an architecture page to the website,
reducing the size of logs using event IDs. They also had productive discussions
with researchers on plans for incremental commits/decommits and had a whiteboard
session on DeFi and lending protocols. The goals for next week include
completing the validation of the timed transactions feature, exploring stateless
observation, refining the Hydra explorer ticket, writing ops instructions and
troubleshooting, and implementing the first end-to-end journey for external
commits.

## High level overview

This week, most of the Mithril team attended the [Cardano Buidler Fest #1](https://buidl.2024.cardano.org/) in Toulouse, France. They also continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks and worked on scaling the signature and proof generation for `mainnet` by compressing the transaction Merkle tree using sub-Merkle trees based on transaction block ranges. The team identified the source of an issue preventing proper memory release during the signing/proving of a large set of transactions and developed a fix for it. Additionally, they completed the prototype for decentralizing signer registration with the relay and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

Finally, the team implemented a configurable feature for test networks to log unparsable blocks instead of panicking and investigated some unexpected error logs occurring on the Cardano node when the signer and aggregator connect to the mini-protocols.

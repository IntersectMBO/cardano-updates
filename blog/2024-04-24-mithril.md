## High level overview

This week, most of the Mithril team attended the [Cardano Buidler Fest #1](https://buidl.2024.cardano.org/) in Toulouse, France. They also continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They kept working on scaling the signature and proof generation for `mainnet` with the compression of the transaction Merkle tree by using sub-Merkle trees of transactions by block ranges. They identified the origin of the issue preventing the memory from being properly released when signing/proving large set of transactions and worked on a fix for it. Additionally, they completed the prototype for decentralizing signer registration with the relay and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

Finally, the team completed the implementation of a configurable feature for test networks to log unparsable blocks instead of panicking and investigated some unexpected error logs occurring on the Cardano node when signer and aggregator connect to the mini-protocols.

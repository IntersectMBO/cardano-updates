## Overview of sprint [94][sprint-94]

### Mithril

We implemented `node-to-node` mini-protocols for `dmq-node`, see [pr#5183].

The PR with `node-to-client` mini-protocols for `dmq-node` ([pr#5173]) is
expected to be merged soon after addressing review comments.

We started working on verification of mithril signatures in the `dmq-node`, see [issue#5175] and [issue#5176].

### Cardano-Node 10.6

We also contributed configuration/tracing changes to `cardano-node` for its `10.6` release.  See [issue#6304].

#### TLDR

We want to simplify user experience of `cardano-node` for `Genesis` and `Praos`
modes:  the network topology file contains bootstrap peers and genesis snapshot
file location, which are only needed in one of the modes.  In some cases,
parsing shouldn't error (as it does now), but just emit a log message of the
right severity.  All the corner cases are described in the [issue][issue#6304].

### Tx-Submission

The new tx-submission decision logic was merged, see [issue#3311].  The new
tx-submission logic was benchmarked in the `ioe` performance cluster.  Additional
work is required to analyse its performance bottlenecks.

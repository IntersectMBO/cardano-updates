## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team worked on implementing the client in the explorer to enable direct verification of certificates from the browser. They also addressed the configuration issue in the signer node service, which occasionally resulted in signers not registering their keys after a restart. Additionally, the team kept implementing a mock aggregator to strengthen Mithril client tests in WASM, continued working on threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking, and progressed with the devnet upgrade to support the Conway era.

Finally, they worked on enhancing the node communications between Mithril and Cardano, and they completed the upgrade of the Cardano node topology used in the Mithril networks' infrastructure.

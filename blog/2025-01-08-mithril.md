## High level overview

The Mithril team released the new distribution [`2450.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2450.0). This distribution offers stable support for Cardano node v.10.1.3, and it includes bug fixes and performance improvements.

The team continued implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database: they kept working on creating and synchronizing the artifacts, they implemented the artifact routes and they started working on the digests route for the incremental Cardano database in the aggregator REST API.

Finally, the team completed the experimental cache for certificate verification in the WASM client, they implemented enhancements to the CI, and they fixed a bug with identifier collisions in the incremental Cardano database artifacts.

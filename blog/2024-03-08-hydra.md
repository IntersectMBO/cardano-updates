### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team has been working on a new library `cardano-api-classy` containing type class instances for era witnesses and also switched nix code to use `flake-parts`. They also further improved the Hydra Head \[explorer\](<http://explorer.hydra.family>) UI. The team also improved error reporting on integration tests and refactored the outcome algebra in the hydra-node protocol logic. Finally, they reviewed the incremental decommit specification with researchers. Meanwhile, SundeaLabs already implemented first UDP and Kinesis event sinks based on the EventSource / EventSink refactoring.

### What did the team achieve this week

- New library `cardano-api-classy` containing type class instances for era witnesses.

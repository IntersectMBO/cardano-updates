## High level overview
This week, the Mithril team updated a proposal for implementing Mithril in a light wallet and created a discussion [on implementing Mithril in a light wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/discussions/1273) to receive feedback and contributions from the community.

They completed the PoC to run a Mithril client in a browser with WASM. They also worked on enhancing the explorer UI with SPO tickers that are displayed next to the pool ids. Additionally, they completed a tool for benchmarking the aggregator performances over a range of signers and clients load, and for visualizing the results of these benchmarks.

Finally, the team added a root page to the aggregator endpoint, created a status page for the Mithril networks, and added a section about KES key rotation in the signer documentation for SPOs.

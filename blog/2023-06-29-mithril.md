## High level overview
The Mithril team completed the design of the signer deployment model for the SPOs to run Mithril on their Cardano `mainnet` infrastructure, and implemented the associated Mithril Relay in the Mithril networks. They started working on the design and implementation of a stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator performances. They worked on the refactoring of the Mithril Stake Distribution entity and the uniformization of the date types in the nodes. They also worked on implementing a new tool command in the aggregator and its first sub-command that helps avoiding re-genesis of the certificate chain when the structure of the certificate is updated. Additionally, they worked on implementing some monitoring for the Mithril infrastructure, and worked on a retry mechanism for the artifact creation of the aggregator.

Finally, they fixed some bugs, and they completed the upgrade of the Mithril networks to Cardano node v.8.1.1.

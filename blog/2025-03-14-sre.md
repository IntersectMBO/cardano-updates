## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* The cardano-node flake closure was cleaned up and optimized for an ~18% size
reduction.

* Cardano-node oci image improvements were merged and should be available with
the next cardano-node release image; see the PR details below.

* The nix hydra machine used for cardano-node builds was migrated to upgraded
hardware allowing for better evaluation concurrency and therefore an enhanced
dev ci experience.

* Long cardano-node nix ci eval times were preliminarily investigated and it
appears this can likely be improved significantly in the near future.


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Cardano-automation
* Removes deprecated flake inputs for optimization purposes and adds ci via
  GHA.  The flake optimization here is also passed to cardano-node.
  [cardano-automation-pr-7](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-automation/pull/7)

### Cardano-node
* OCI improvements: adds symlinked configuration files for cardano
  environments, adds a new cardano-node oci image "merge" mode, improves
  documentation, reduces path inconsistencies between images modes (cardano-node
  oci script, merge, custom modes) and oci-images (cardano-node and
  cardano-submit-api).  More detail is available in the PR description.
  [cardano-node-pr-6110](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6110)

* Byron-to-Alonzo scripts and env clean up: removes deprecated environments and
  dependencies, adds testnet template support, improves the byron to alonzo
  script set and documents.  More detail is available in the PR description.
  [cardano-node-pr-6123](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6123)

* Flake clean up and optimization: removes uneeded inputs and overlay, applies
  alejandra fmt, adds alejandra to dev/devops devShell, reduces overall flake
  closure size by ~18%.  More detail is available in the PR description.
  [cardano-node-pr-6144](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6144)

### Devx-ci

* The nix hydra build machine was migrated to new hardware with more memory.
  Deprecated ziti code was cleaned up.
  [devx-ci-commit-compare](https://github.com/input-output-hk/devx-ci/compare/1fd4e26..7bc0c28)

### Inputs-check
* The inputs-check tool was improved to make usage easier in non-flake-parts
  flakes, fix a top level duplicate inputs bug, improve docs with better
  instructions and more example usage, and add minimal ci.
  [inputs-check-pr-1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/inputs-check/pull/1)

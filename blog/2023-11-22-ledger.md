## High level summary

Last two weeks progress was mainly on testing, bug fixes and improvements to clarity of
CDDL specification. Important bugfixes include:

* Fix deserialization of `ValueNotConservedUTxO` predicate failure that could not
  previously report zero ADA.
* Fix deserialization of `CostModels` in the `PParamsUpdate`. Invalid `CostModels` are no
  longer allowed, only `CostModels` for unrecognized Plutus versions are allowed starting
  with Conway
* Fix returning of Deposits for ProposalProcedures

Testing tooling has been improved and new tests have been implemented for Conway era.

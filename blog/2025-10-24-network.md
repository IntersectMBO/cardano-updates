## Overview of sprint [98][sprint-98] and [99][sprint-99]

### Cardano-Node 10.6 Release

We swiftly identified and resolved an issue in the
`Ouroboros.Network.Server.Simple.with` function. This bug broke
`cardano-tracer` component, [on#5224], [on#5223]. The function hasn't been used
in `cardano-node` before. `ouroboros-network-framework-0.19.2.0` was released
([chap#1157]).

We'd like to point out that `cardano-node-10.6` will come supporting only P2P network stack.

For this coming release, we addressed some corner cases in topology parsing,
[cn#6304].

### DMQ-Node

We continued working on `dmq-node`.  Recently, an end-to-end test was successfully
run using the `mithril` Rust client, submitting signatures to a `dmq-node`, which
propagated them to another instance of `dmq-node`. [on#5203]

We found out and fixed a bug in `typed-protocol`'s annotated driver, which is
used by `dmq-node`: [on#5207].

A static build of `dmq-node` is now also available for the
`x86_64-linux-musl` target:
```shell
nix build .#dmq-node-static
```

The trace & monitoring team is helping us to integrate `dmq-node` with
the `cardano-tracer` library.  The aim is to give SPO the familiar user experience
when monitoring `dmq-node`.

### Peer Selection Improvements

A number of discrepancies were found and fixed in the peer selection logic.
The `peer-selection` and `net-sim` tests were improved: [on#5209], [on#5232]

### WASM support in Ouroboros-Network

The `node` team contributed a partial `WASM` support to `ouroboros-network`,
[on#5229].

### Technical Debt Reduction

#### Ouroboros-Network

We reorganised the `ouroboros-network` package structure to improve
maintainability and simplify our release process, [on#5200].

* `cardano-diffusion`: everything related to diffusion for `Cardano` purposes,
   in particular `cardano-node`, but not only.
* `ouroboros-network-api`, `ouroboros-network-framework`,
  `ouroboros-network-protocols` packages are now sublibraries of
  `ouroboros-network`.  Some Cardano-specific APIs are only present in
  `cardano-diffusion`. 
* `cardano-client` package is now just a sublibrary: `cardano-diffusion:subscription`.
* `cardano-ping` will become a sublibrary: `cardano-diffusion:ping` once [on#5205] is merged.

#### Consensus

We addressed some outstanding TODOs in the `ouroboros-consensus-diffusion`
package, see [oc#1660].

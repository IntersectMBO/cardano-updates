## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team completed the implementation of the mock DMQ node to support end-to-end testing of decentralized signature diffusion. They worked on updating the CIP of the DMQ protocol and its implementations in Pallas and Mithril nodes. They also worked on refactoring the Cardano database verification new command to provide better error messages. Additionally, the team continued collaborating with the innovation team on prototyping a SNARK proving circuit for Mithril certificates.

Finally, they kept prototyping a Mithril/Cardano bundle in a Docker image and made progress refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

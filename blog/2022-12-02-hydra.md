## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team has worked on cleaning up several things in progress
after last week's summit. They have extended their model-based testing (MBT)
approach with transaction creation & observation
[#410](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/410), solved
`AcquirePointTooOld` problems of the `hydra-node` with by changing the wallet
initialization [#439](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/439).
Also, the Hydra researchers updated the security proofs of the Coordinated Hydra
Head, which are bound to be included in the Hydra HeadV1 specification.

## What did the team achieve this week

- Monthly review & report - will also be published on our website [#644](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/644)

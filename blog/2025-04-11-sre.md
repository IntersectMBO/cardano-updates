## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Cardano-node, cardano-cli, and db-sync versions are now set to `10.2.1` and
`10.4.0.0`, `13.6.0.5`, respectively, in cardano-parts release `v2025-04-03`.

* The [blockfrost-platform](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform)
is now in capkgs and cardano-parts default devShell, pkgs and cluster
flakeModules.

* `ConsensusMode` cardano-node configuration and supporting files were added to
the baseline node configurations in iohk-nix and integrated into cardano-node for
the `10.3.x` \[pre-]release.  This will make experimenting with `GenesisMode`
easier.  Relevant files and info will be published to the [Cardano
Book](https://book.play.dev.cardano.org/) soon.


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Capkgs:
* Adds the blockfrost platform to capkgs
  [capkgs-pr-4](https://github.com/input-output-hk/capkgs/pull/4)

* Refactors and expands ci to support fork PRs gracefully. Adds a manual
  workflow dispatch option with `pr_number` input for maintainers to authorize a
  privileged ci run on a forked PR. Utilizes composite actions for easy re-use
  elsewhere.
  [capkgs-pr-6](https://github.com/input-output-hk/capkgs/pull/6)


### Cardano-parts
* Sets node release to `10.2.1`, cardano-cli release to `10.4.0.0`,
  cardano-db-sync to `13.6.0.5` and mithril-cli to `v2513.0`.  Adds
  profile-cardano-node-topology SRV record support for cardano-node producers.
  Fixes a process-compose node health check broken in newer versions of
  cardano-cli and adds node binary to the nixosCfgs system path.
  [cardano-parts-release-v2025-04-03](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts/releases/tag/v2025-04-03)

* Adds the blockfrost platform to shell, pkgs, and cluster cardano-parts
  flakeModules.  Futures PRs will extend that to a blockfrost process-compose nix
  run job as well as dashboard for blockfrost deployments.

### Cardano-mainnet
* Rotates KES, adds bootstrap and stakepool resource specific tags for cost
  analysis, improves the demo recipes to dynamic waits to avoid brittle time
  delay failures.  Includes the version bumps from cardano-parts release `v2025-04-03`.
  [cardano-mainnet-pr-32](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-mainnet/pull/32)


### Cardano-node
* Node 10.3.x release branch preparation: SRE contribution for iohk-nix
  PR#596 integration, CI tests fixup and docker cli arg bug fixup.
  [cardano-node-pr-6143](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6143)


### Iohk-nix
* Adds support for genesis mode in node with: node config for genesis mode and
  related options, checkpoint file for mainnet and updated peer snapshot files
  for all envs, checkpoint and peer snapshot files are now included in
  mkConfigHtml output

## High-level overview of [sprint 66][sprint-66]

We held The Network Working Group (NWG) in the last sprint.  Below, we share
recordings of this and earlier NWG meetings, which introduce basic notions of
`ouroboros-network`.  These recordings should be accessible to a technical
audience.

### Introduction to Ouroboros Network, NWG, part 1

```

### Tx-Submission

We continued working on the new design of tx-submission.  We progressed in writing
a new tx-submission server (inbound side of tx-submission protocol)
instrumented by decision logic.  The next step is writing a simulation that
runs N-pairs of `client`-`server` communications in which the same decision logic governs all `server`s - emulating the behaviour of `cardano-node` once the new tx-submission is integrated.  For more details, see
[ouroboros-network#3311]

### Genesis integration

All outstanding PRs related to Genesis have been reviewed and accepted.  Soon
they will be merged.

* **Big Ledger Peer Targets for Genesis** - [ouroboros-network#4832]
* **Feed peer selection governor with big ledger peers obtained from a snapshot** - [ouroboros-network#4850]
* **Introduction of serialization instances in support of ledger peer snapshot** - [ouroboros-network#4851]
* **Verification of big ledger peer snapshot file** - [ouroboros-network#4888]

### Mithril Integration

We presented ideas on how to run mithril functionalities with
`cardano-node` while taking into account the risks that such integration would impose on
the system.  The technical description will be part of a CIP, which will then go to
the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for an evaluation.

## Smaller tasks

* **Small improvements and bug fix in the Signal API**, [ouroboros-network#4909]
* **Improved memory foot-print of tests on ghc-9.8**, [ouroboros-network#4912]
* **Error cardano-ping whenever there's a decoding error**, [ouroboros-network#4916]

### Open-Source contributions

We found out and fixed a bug in the `iproute` parser of `IPv4` addresses:
* **Check that IPv4 addresses terminate**, [iproute#63]
* **IPv4 address with mask should not contain a white space**, [iproute#64]

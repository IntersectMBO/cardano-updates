## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the [threat modeling explainer](https://mithril.network/doc/next/mithril/threat-model) for the documentation website. They also continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They kept implementing the low-latency certification with the retrieval of transactions using the chain sync mini-protocol and Pallas. Additionally, the team started working on the the redaction of a draft CIP for the diffusion of Mithril signatures through the Cardano network.

Finally, they fixed a bug that prevented the verification of the transactions included in the last certified block, and they improved the documentation of the WASM client.

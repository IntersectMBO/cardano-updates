## Overview of sprints [89][sprint-89], [90][sprint-90]

We released the `ouroboros-network-0.21.2.0` version, which was adopted by `cardano-node-10.5`.

We created integration branches for `ouroboros-network:cardano-diffusion` with `ouroboros-consensus`, `ekg-forward` and `cardano-node` repositories (all called `coot/cardano-diffusion-integration`.  We merged [__cardano-diffusion: integration changes__][#5139] to `ouroboros-network`.

After the release of `QuickCheck-2.16`, which includes one of our contributions ([__Added Every and Some monoid__][QC#397], we removed dependency on `quickcheck-monoids` and deprecated its API, [#5142].

We merged the following pull requests:
* [__inbound governor performance improvement__][#5104]
* [__lower the time to cache DNS errors__][#5143]
* we fixed [__bootstrap test failure in sim-net__][#5132]

We also worked on improving our CI (Hydra) experience.  In the short term, we decided not to run computationally expensive simulations on `{aarch64,x86_64}-darwin` architectures.  These simulations are platform independent, and they quite often timed out due to not enough CPU bandwidth, see [#5145]

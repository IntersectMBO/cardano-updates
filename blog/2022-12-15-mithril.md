## High level overview
The Mithril team has released the new distribution [`2248.1`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2248.1) of their nodes. They have published the first version of the Mithril cryptographic library on [`crates.io`](https://crates.io/crates/mithril-stm), the Rust communityâ€™s crate registry. They have implemented an optimization on the individual signatures that no longer embed the verification key and stake. They have also enhanced their testing strategy by implementing a workflow that tests that the client binaries produced for multiple platforms (Linux, MacOS and Windows) are able to verify and restore snapshots.

Finally, they have kept on simplifying the aggregator node's multi-signer by removing the signer registration and the certificate creation from its responsibilities.

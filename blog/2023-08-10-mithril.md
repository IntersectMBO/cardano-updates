## High level overview
The Mithril team completed the **Mithril protocolâ€™s mainnet beta** launch: the `release-mainnet` network is now consistently producing new certificates and snapshots! The team has released a new distribution [`2331.1`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2331.1) which includes some optimizations and bug fixes: the bootstrap time of a Cardano node restored from a Mithril snapshot has been significantly reduced, and a bug that made the aggregator produce corrupted archives has been fixed. They also kept working on the implementation of the stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator: the first phase has been implemented, as well as a monitoring feature. Additionally, they kept implementing the refactoring of the serialization/deserialization of the entities of the cryptographic library, and working on the post deployment of the `mainnet` infrastructure.

Finally, they completed the rewriting and enhancements of the documentation website, and they completed the runbook for operating a production Mithril network.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued working on a prototype 'slave' mode of the aggregator to support signer registration across multiple aggregators: the feature is being stabilized and tested. They also focused on implementing incremental certification of the Cardano database, emphasizing feature stabilization, production readiness, testing, and optimization. Additionally, they started to refactor the cryptographic library to improve clarity and maintainability, and they kept working on signing ancillary files in the Cardano database snapshots with an IOG key.

Finally, the team enhanced the database tooling for migration and maintenance, and they fixed some flakiness in the CI.

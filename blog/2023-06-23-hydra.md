## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team shared progress updates during the monthly review
meeting (monthly report and video recording available soon) and started
experimenting on preview network with the new commit from external wallet
feature.

  wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/887)

  Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/unstable/benchmarks/end-to-end-benchmarks)
- Moved forward the journey for external commits using multiple script UTxOs

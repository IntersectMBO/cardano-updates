## High-level overview of [sprint 70][sprint-70]

### Cardano CLI

`cardano-cli ping` command cannot send pings over unix sockets using
`node-to-client` mini-protocol (since it doesn't support it).  In that case, the command will
now show a user-friendly error message.  See [cardano-cli#49].

### Mithril

We held a session with the mithril team to discuss design & implementation of
Mithril using `ouroboros-network`.

### Ouroboros-Network

#### TxSubmission Logic

We continued working on `tx-submission` logic.  We developed new tests that
run several simulated outbound peers offering transactions and a single
inbound peer governed by the new `tx-submission` logic. Ref [ouroboros-network#3311].

The next step is to clean the branch and integrate it with
`ouroboros-consensensus` & `cardano-node` for early e2e tests.

#### Bulk-Sync for Genesis

We reviewed the new bulk-sync application for Genesis mode, see [ouroboros-network#4919].

#### Typed-Protocols

We reviewed the new `typed-protocols` API PR.  It was recently merged
& published to [CHaP][typed-protocols-0.2.0.0].  Once `Haskell.Nix` has better support for
public sub-libraries, we will package all the libraries in one package and
publish it on `Hackage`.  Ref: [typed-protocols#52].

The next step is to update, review the integration PR in `ouroboros-network`,
see [ouroboros-network#4935].

#### Nightly Tests

We fixed a long-due failure on a nightly test.  The failure was due to `IOSimPOR`
ability to reorder simulated `IO` actions, resulting in a wrong order of
events.  So, it's not a bug in the production code but in the test itself. See [ouroboros-network#4948].

#### Updated readme file

We updated the dependency graph in our [README.md] file.

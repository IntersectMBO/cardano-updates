## High level summary

Few important Conway related features were completed in this two week period:

* Constitutional Committee was the last missing Conway related entity that has now been
 fully implemented.
* Treasury withdrawals governance actions have been fixed and now behave as expected.
* Current treasury amount supplied in the transaction is now enforced by the rules.
* DRep's expiry is prevented by delaying the expiry for all DReps whenever there are no
proposals to vote on.
* Semantics of how CostModels are updated with Protocol Parameters have been changed to
allow for individual Plutus language version updates, rather than requiring a complete
replacement of all CostModels

Besides the new features there were also important performance and testing improvements:

* In particular stake distribution computation and native script handling received some
optimizations.
* New testing DSL has been implemented that drastically simplifies writing unit tests for
ledger rules.
* Integration tests and benchmarks are now possible for Conway era because of the overhaul
of functionality for initial funds and staking injection whenever node starts up in
Conway, while bypassing all previous eras.

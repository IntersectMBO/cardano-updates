## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept implementing a new type of data for certifying the Cardano transactions set in Mithril networks: they completed the signature of the transactions set and they implememented the aggregator route which generates proofs of membership for a list of Cardano transactions. They also finished implementing the manual workflow to test the npm client package in the CI, and they improved the resilience of the computation of the list of immutable files in a Cardano node database. Additionally, the team extended the coverage of the end to end test in the CI to handle multiple versions of the Cardano node and different hard fork scenario.

Finally, they completed the enhanced node communications between Mithril and Cardano for retrieving UTxOs, and they kept working on the threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking.

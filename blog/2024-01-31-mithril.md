## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing a new data type for certifying Cardano transactions within Mithril networks. They completed the signature of the transactions set and implemented the aggregator route, responsible for generating proofs of membership for a list of Cardano transactions. Additionally, they finalized the manual workflow to test the NPM client package in the CI and enhanced the resilience of computing the list of immutable files in a Cardano node database. The team also expanded the coverage of end-to-end tests in the CI to accommodate multiple versions of the Cardano node and various hard fork scenarios.

Finally, they completed the enhanced node communications between Mithril and Cardano for retrieving UTXOs and kept working on the threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking.

## Overview of [sprint 74][sprint-74]

### Dropping NonP2P network stack

We are advertising that we will drop the non-p2p network stack.  This will
happen after the next hard fork.  Please comment on the PR if this will be
problematic for you.  Here's the PR: [ouroboros-network#5007].

### Node-to-Client versions

We dropped `node-to-client` versions earlier than version `16`,
[ouroboros-network#5002].

### Mithril Design

We completed [review][ouroboros-mithril] how to adopt ouroboros-network for
Mithril design.  We started to experiment with `ouroboros-network` in that
direction.

### Next Cardano-Node release

The next `cardano-node` release will include the following changes from the
networking team:

#### Typed-Protocols

The integration of `ouroboros-network-0.18`, which is using the new
`typed-protocols-0.3` with `ouroboros-consensus`, was merged,
[ouroboros-consensus#1223].  Integration with `cardano-cli` and `cardano-api`
was rebased and handed to the release engineer.  Integration with `ekg-forward`
was merged: [ekg-forward#35].

#### Genesis

The following changes to support Genesis (both creating big ledger peer
snapshots & providing them in a topology file)

* [`cardano-api`: **Added a new query for a snapshot of big ledger peers**][cardano-api#521]
* [`cardano-cli`: **Query a node for a snapshot of big ledger peers**][cardano-cli#727]
* [`cardano-node`: **Support for big ledger peer snapshot in the topology file**][cardano-node#5787]

### Connection Manager

We merged the documentation review of the connection manager, [ouroboros-network#5001].
We also renamed connection manager methods (as suggested by Neil Davies
([PNSOL])): [ouroboros-network#5000].

### Outbound Governor

We started to experiment with using FRP to implement the outbound governor in a way
that is both easier to maintain and reason about.

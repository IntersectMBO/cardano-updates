### High-level Summary

This sprint, the Hydra team updated the node to be compatible with cardano-node 8.11-pre. We continued work on increment decommits, investigating adversarial attacks on the smart contract and preparing it to be merged. We also discussed options for the incremental commit work, including designs for a `hydra-ledger`.

Next sprint we aim to merge incremental decommits and make further progress on the incremental commit design.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the `2543.1` hotfix distribution, which fixes an issue in the previous release that caused some Mithril signers to stop signing until the end of the current epoch after being restarted.

The team has nearly completed the first phase of decentralizing configuration parameters and continued implementing a simple aggregator discovery mechanism. They also advanced work on the SNARK-friendly STM library by designing its architecture, implementing the Schnorr signature scheme, refactoring error handling, and experimenting with a Jubjub curve implementation in the BLST library.

Finally, the team worked on refactoring the interface used by the signer to interact with the aggregator and improved the protocol security page.

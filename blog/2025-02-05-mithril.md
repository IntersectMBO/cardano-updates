## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team has created the transaction that activates the switch to the next 'Pythagoras' Mithril era: it will occur at transition to the Cardano epoch `539`. They have also started announcing the upcoming bump of the minimum version of `glibc` required to run the Mithril pre-built binaries on Linux.

The team has also kept implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database: they worked on the implementations of the client library, the client CLI and the WASM client, and they started implementing monitoring and dashboarding. Additionally, they started working on the refactoring of the 'mithril-common' library and the simplification of the dependency builder in the aggregator.

Finally, the team worked on dropping support for pre-built binaries for MacOS x64 architecture, and attempted to fix some flakiness in the end-to-end tests in the CI.

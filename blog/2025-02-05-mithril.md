## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team created the transaction to activate the switch to the next ‘Pythagoras’ Mithril era, which will occur at the transition to Cardano epoch 539. They also started communicating the upcoming bump in the minimum version of `glibc` required to run Mithril pre-built binaries on Linux.

The team continued implementing incremental certification of the Cardano database, working on the client library, client CLI, and WASM client. They also began implementing monitoring and dashboarding. Additionally, they started refactoring the ‘mithril-common’ library and simplifying the dependency builder in the aggregator.

Finally, the team worked on dropping support for pre-built binaries for macOS x64 architecture and attempted to fix some flakiness in end-to-end tests in the CI.

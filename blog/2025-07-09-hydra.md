### High-level summary

The team have been highly focused on work supporting the glacier drop; in
particular fixing a bug related to replaying a large statefile, and preparing
a release that includes that fix (0.22.2). We continue work to improve some
observed issues with our resiliance to restarts during processing high
volumes of transactions.

### What did the team achieve?

* Released version [0.22.2](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/releases/tag/0.22.2)
* Marked release version 0.22.1 as deprecated; do not use, it contains a simple bug that prevents `--network <...>` from working correctly.
* Resolved bug with node getting into deadlock while restarting [#2089](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/2089)
* Show a list off "Offline" peers in the TUI [#2044](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/2044)
* Set the content-type for the API server responses [#2094](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/2094)
* Small fix to the documentation [#2095](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/2095)
* Continued to support the glacier drop

### What's next?

* Focus on improving crash-resiliance [#2109](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/2109)
* Add HTTP endpoint for submitting transaction [#2107](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/2107)

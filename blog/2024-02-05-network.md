## High-level overview of [sprint 54][sprint-54]


In this sprint, we merged the bootstrap peers (aka weak genesis) changes to
the `ouroboros-network` repository ([ouroboros-network#4615]).  We continued
working on integration & testing it using an early development version of
`cardano-node` ([cardano-node#5485]).

[Andrew Westberg] ([DripDropz]) noticed and fixed a mistake in the cddl spec which resulted in
misleading documentation; [ouroboros-network#4790]. The Handshake protocol flag
should be called `initiatorOnlyDiffusionMode`.  Library authors providing
connectivity with other nodes via the `node-to-node` protocol are advised to review
their implementation.

We continued working on the `tx-submission` decision logic;
[ouroboros-network#3311].

[Karl Knutsson] ([CF]) implemented:

* a debugging feature which dumps outbound governor state on the `SIGUSR1` event
  (supported on *POSIX* compatible OSes); [ouroboros-network#4730], [ouroboros-network#4789].
* limited the rate at which one can discover nodes through peer sharing;
  [ouroboros-network#4778].

## Open Source Contributions

### IOSim

We released a new version of [io-sim to Hackage][io-sim-1.4.0.0]:
* [Sebastian Nagel] (IOG) fixed a bug in the `flushTQueue` implementation; [io-sim#135]
* We fixed the underflow error in `threadDelay` in the `si-timers` library
  ([io-sim#129]) reported by [Nick Frisby] (Tweag)

### NoThunks

We released a new version of [nothunks to Hackage][nothunks-0.2.0.0]:
* `wherefrom` support; [nothunks#46]
* added `Solo` instance; [nothunks#45]
* added instances for `Monoid` and `Semigroup` newtype wrappers; [nothunks#43]

## Low-level summary

* We started using the `ImportQualifiedPost` extension, hence a large
  (autogenerated) syntax change; [ouroboros-network#4715].
* Code cleanup; [ouroboros-network#4792]

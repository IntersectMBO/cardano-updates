### High-level Summary

This week, the Hydra team conducted yearly roadmapping sessions, introduced a
breaking API change to eliminate JSON encoding of transactions (refer to issue
#1213 for details), completed off-chain logic for incremental decommits through,
and implemented a hydra-explorer backend.

### What did the team achieve this week

-   Conducted yearly roadmapping sessions
-   Merged a breaking API change to drop JSON encoding of transactions [#1213](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1213) - contact us if you were relying on this.

### What are the goals of next week

-   Publish the monthly report
-   Prepare PRs for hydra clients to switch to CBOR due to the changed API (see above)
-   Enhance the model testing framework to cover close/contest (needed to fix a bug and incremental decommit development)

## Overview of sprints [91][sprint-91], [92][sprint-92]

### Cardano-Node changes

The default value for `PeerSharing` configuration option in
`cardano-node-10.5.1` will be:
* `false` if the node is configured as a block producer
* `true` if the node is configured as a relay

See [PR#6284], [PR#6274].

We also deprecated `cardano-node run` command line flag `--non-producing-node`
in favour of `--start-as-non-producing-node`.

### Chain-Sync

We modified `chain-sync` timeout implementation.  The idle timeout will be
chosen randomly each time `chain-sync` mini-protocol enters `StIdle` state,
while before the timeout was fixed during connection lifetime (although it was
still random).  This was done to eliminate survivor bias, where long-lived
connections were those which had longer timeouts.  Now it should be fairer
for all connections.

Note that this timeout will be triggered due to a suffciently large gap between
consecutive blocks, as a result of Cardano's probabilistic schedule.

See [PR#4980].

### SRV support according to [CIP#155]

We merged SRV support according to [CIP#155], see [PR#5131].

### PeerSharing in InitiatorOnlyMode

We made it possible to configure `PeerSharing` on connections which negotiated
`InitiatorOnlyDiffusionMode`. See ([PR#5148], [Issue#5124]).

### Releases

* [`ouroboros-network-0.21.3.0`][releases], [PR#5162], `cardano-node-10.5.1`
* [`ouroboros-network-0.22.0.0`][releases], [PR#5154], `cardano-node-10.6`
* [`ouroboros-network-0.22.1.0`][releases], [PR#5166], [PR#1570], `cardano-node-10.6` (in progress)

### Ongoing work

We are currently focused on `dmq-node` for Mithril ([Issue#5117]) and testing
the new `tx-submission` system ([Issue#3311])

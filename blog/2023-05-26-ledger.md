## High level summary

The ledger team made progress on the conway ledger era. In particular, the design and implementation
of the new certificates is near complete, we refactored some of our data structures
to be able to support DReps, we cleaned up the serialization format, and renamed things to make
clearer the differences with Shelley.

The team also completed integration work for the next node release, namely 8.1.0.
And, as always, we continue to address technical debt.

## High level summary

This is a slow season when people usually take vacation, for this reason there is not that much to
report.  We have defined `PlutusV4` for Dijkstra, which for now only acts as a placeholder and is
semantically equivalent to `PlutusV3`. Besides that we've done some code cleanup and a serialization
bug fix for pre-Conway eras.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They focused on scaling the signature and proof generation for `mainnet`, completed the implementation of a more versatile beaconing mechanism, worked on implementing an incremental storage of the transactions, and fixed the bug in the block parser that prevented some Conway transactions from being signed. Additionally, they continued working on a prototype to decentralize signer registration with the relay and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

Finally, the team made some improvements on the internal storage of the data of the test aggregator server, and fixed a source of flakiness in the CI end-to-end test.

## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Cardano-node release `10.1.2` was deployed to all environments

* Dbsync release `13.6.0.1` was deployed to all environments

* Just recipe `query-gov-action-status` was added to aid in live voting
  analysis of governance actions

* The mainnet bootstrap cluster was scaled temporarily to accommodate a
  significant increase in client load which developed during the past week

* With scheduled end of year vacation time and holidays starting, the cadence
  of work is expected to slow a bit in the following few node SRE updates

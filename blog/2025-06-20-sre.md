## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Ouroboros-network-ops cluster was upgraded to the latest cardano-parts
release with ssh over ssm usage.

* The performance and tracing benchmarking cluster was upgraded to utilize
ephemeral NVMe block devices for use in benchmarking ledger LMDB backend.

* Blockperf, a software for measuring block propagation times in cardano networks,
was [updated](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/blockperf/pull/32) to
support the new tracing system.

* Work to utilize the new tracing system as default for shipped configs such as
in release artifacts, docker oci and cardano book as well as nixos module
services continues and is near ready for merge.  The cardano-node new tracing
system related PRs currently listed in the "Repository Work In Progress"
section are planned for merge prior to node `10.6.0` tagging.

### High-level summary

This last few weeks have been focused on incremental commits, re-writing more
validators in Aiken, and the associated changes that have come about as the
our scripts sizes increase. We continue along on prioritising incremental
commits and a 0.20.0 release, as well as some repository cleanup and
additional functionality based on user requests.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the new distribution [`2437.1`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2437.1) which includes stable support for Cardano transactions certification and Cardano stake distribution certification in the signer and the aggregator, a breaking change of the Mithril client WASM handling the unstable features, and also includes bug fixes and performance improvements.

The Mithril team continued working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. They completed the implementation of a buffer store for individual signatures that may arrive before being processed by an aggregator, completed the refactoring of the signer state machine, and kept working on a mechanism to support specific configurations for signing Cardano transactions. Additionally, they worked on the autonomous computation of the messages to be signed by the signer.

Finally, the team worked on a refactoring of the service which computes the messages to certify in the signer and aggregator, and fixed the problem preventing the consistent certification of Cardano transactions in the `pre-release-preview` network.

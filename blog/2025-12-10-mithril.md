## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued focusing on the SNARK-friendly STM library, simplifying its code and implementing some wrappers for the Jubjub backend. They also made progress by specifying the non-recursive SNARK circuit, assessing constraints on Halo2 verification keys, designing a testing strategy for SNARK circuits, prototyping the recursive SNARK solution, and completing a prototype of the Bitcoin DeFi prover with RISC Zero.

Additionally, they completed the simple aggregator discovery mechanism, worked on improvements to the protocol security page, and completed the second phase of the common aggregator client implementation.

Finally, they worked on CI enhancements by implementing dependency license enforcement and fixing bugs in crate publication, and kept upgrading the Cardano node to v.10.6.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team delivered support for Cardano node v.10.4.1 and UTXO-HD in the aggregator, signer, and client.

They completed the implementation of the local message submission and local message notification node-to-client mini-protocols in the Pallas library for the DMQ node. They also continued extending the aggregator metrics to record the usage of different client types. Additionally, they worked on stabilizing the Cardano DB v2 client commands in the CLI and API in the library, ensuring readiness for production use.

Finally, the team began switching the protocol message encoding to binary and continued refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team started rolling out incremental certification of the Cardano database (also known as Cardano node database v2), which has been activated on the `pre-release-preview` test network.

They also completed adapting the infrastructure to support the aggregator’s prototype ‘follower’ mode and focused on signing ancillary files in the Cardano database snapshots using an IOG key. Work also continued on the proof of concept for the Mithril/ALBA aggregation proof system.

Finally, the team continued refactoring the STM cryptographic library to improve clarity and started refactoring the aggregator’s command configuration.

## High level summary

This period we reached a major milestone, namely we now have an initial version of Conway
conformance testing working. We are now able to generate random valid data with the help
of constraint based testing framework, apply that data to Conway Ledger rules and verify
that the output matches to the one produced by the executable version of the Formal Ledger
Specification, when it is applied to the same random data.

We also had a couple of Conway bugs fixed and a few new predicate check implemented. Get
Constitutional Committee query is complete and tested. Various improvements to the
testing tools. Addition of more test cases.

## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team conducted the monthly review meeting for Agust,which
continously ensures transparent communication and project evaluation.

In terms of community engagement, the Hydra team gave a Hydra master-class at
RareEvo workshop as an educational initiative for the community.
Additionally, the team updated the Hydra demo and tutorial to include Mithril
and latest release changes.

They also focused on exploring the Hydra network resiliance in order to improve
`hydra-node` availability, as it becomes stuck very easily and that leads to a
bad user experience.

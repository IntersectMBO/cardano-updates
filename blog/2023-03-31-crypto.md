## Low level summary
### Mithril
* Started designing how a full-node verifier would work. Issue comming in the next couple of weeks. 
### cardano-base
* BLS12-381 branch merged [PR#266](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/266). 
* Testing strategy for BLS bindings:
    * Test-vectors for Groth16, and simple BLS signatures ready.
    * Test-vectors with different library, and created by different engineer. 
### KES agent
* Resolved issues of circular dependency
* Got rid of separate DSIGN and DSIGNM, we now have DSIGN over mlocked keys, but the phantom type is the same.  
* Opened a PR for raw bearer branch in ouroboros network [PR4395](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4395)
* Resolved a bug where the agent node did not properly closed connections
* Updated version of [IOSim](https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/70) allowed us to finish a first version of KES agent.
### Sidechains
* Included [BLS12-381](https://github.com/iquerejeta/halo2curves/commit/1ccf987b772dcfaa3c1e3439a4a28f23fcf07c7a) curve to our branch of halo2curves
* Included [JubJub](https://github.com/iquerejeta/halo2curves/commit/3f20edb2ed112733a0a0986b0a0386c1b9bc439f) to our branch of halo2curves 
### MuSig2
* Minor reorg [PR#42](https://github.com/input-output-hk/musig2/pull/42)

## High level overview
The Mithril team released a new [`2318.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2318.0) distribution that implements the last migration phase of the aggregator stores and embeds a bug fix for the signer registration. They also completed the implementation of the interfaces defined to provide certification for the immutable full snapshot of Cardano files and Mithril stake distribution. They finalized the implementation of the framework to sign generic types of data in the aggregator and the signer nodes. They also updated the runtime of the aggregator to handle open messages associated with the available types, and evolved the REST API of the aggregator to deliver the artifacts for these types. Additionally, they have upgraded the network explorer in order to display the artifacts and certificates for these different types.

Finally, the team started designing an on-chain decentralized signer registration process, and started implementing the new stake distribution computation available from Cardano node `8.0.0` (along with the backward compatibility for previous `1.35.x` versions).

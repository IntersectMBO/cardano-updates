## High-level summary

This week the Hydra team accomplished some nice progress. They secured the
network layer further by implementing authentication of the messages between
the peers in the Head protocol. In the process they also managed to separate
HeartBeat messages from the protocol ones which somewhat improved the quality
of code in Hydra. The team also finished work related to sending only
transaction ids in ReqSn messages and fixed an issue in our smoke-tests. They
also published multiple benchmarks on their website and identified a bug in the
signature validation and issued a pull request to
[fix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-ghsa-c8qp-cv4h-vcc4/pull/1)
this.

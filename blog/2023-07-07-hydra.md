## High-level summary

This week the Hydra team accomplished some nice progress. They secured the
network layer further by implementing authentication of the messages between the
peers in the Head protocol. In the process they also managed to separate
HeartBeat messages from the protocol ones which somewhat improved the quality of
code in Hydra. The team also finished work related to sending only transaction
ids in ReqSn messages, fixed an issue in the smoke tests, and improved benchmark
publishing on the website.

## What did the team achieve this week

- [Implemented](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/727) authenticated messages

- Publish multiple pre-defined [benchmarks](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/947)
- [Fixed](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/967) a smoke-test issue where funds would not be returned to the faucet
- Found a bug in the [off-chain signature
  verification](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-ghsa-c8qp-cv4h-vcc4/pull/1)

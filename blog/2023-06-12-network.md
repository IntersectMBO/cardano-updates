## Network Update

### Key contributions and advances

We merged `light peer sharing` feature, which allows to include inbound peers
into outbound governor known peers.  This is the primary way for new
unregistered nodes to enter the network, which then can be shared using peer
sharing.  Note that peer sharing is an experimental feature which is disabled
until genesis & eclipse evasion as fully implemented. See [#3596].

We are making progress reviewing eclipse evasion, [#3886].

We fixed another bug in local root peers.  We found out that if the local roots
where ignored until the first domain name was resolved, see [#4583].  The bug
fix was backported and released in `ouroboros-network-0.8.1.1`.

We re-started working on dynamically enabling block forging to address issue
[#3159], which will enable us to release `P2P` on block producing nodes. See [#140].

#### New `cardano-ping` / `cardano-cli ping` release

We prepared a new release of `cardano-ping` library which supports the new
query feature (query supported versions). See [#4589], [#4593] and [#5313].
The new version of `cardano-cli ping` will use `ISO8601` formatted
timestamps; also the formatting of ping results is slightly improved, and it
will introduce the new `--query-versions` (`-Q`) switch.  If the remote site
supports the query parameter, the command will print:
```
redacted-ip:port network rtt: 0.064
redacted-ip:port handshake rtt: 0.064010896s
redacted-ip:port Queried versions [NodeToNodeVersionV11 764824073 InitiatorAndResponder,NodeToNodeVersionV10 764824073 InitiatorAndResponder,NodeToNodeVersionV9 764824073 Initiat
orAndResponder,NodeToNodeVersionV8 764824073 InitiatorAndResponder,NodeToNodeVersionV7 764824073 InitiatorAndResponder]
```
otherwise it will print the negotiation results
```
redacted-ip:port network rtt: 0.045
redacted-ip:port handshake rtt: 0.101867615s
redacted-ip:port Negotiated version NodeToNodeVersionV10 764824073 InitiatorAndResponder
```
Note that in that case `cardano-cli ping` offers `InitiatorAndResponder`, which
allows us to detect whether the remote side is an `InitiatorOnly` or
`InitiatorAndResponder`.   Also `cardano-cli ping` will no longer announce
itself as `InitiatorAndResponder`, except for the case mentioned above.

### Other smaller contributions

On a request from the Marlow Team, we published haddocks of `typed-protocols`,
which are now available [here][typed-protocols-haddocks] ([#40], [#41]).

We made a new release of `stric-stm-1.1.0.1` on Hackage, which fixed a bug in
package description file, [#101] .

We also helped to debug a deadlock when using named pipes on Windows in the new
`RawBearer` API.  The API is being used to store secret keys only in memory.
The PR [#4395] is under review.

We also have two more PRs which are under review:

* [#4530]: enabling ledger peers on a fixed number of slots before the tip of the chain;
* [#4580]: a PR which fixes inconsistencies in one of our cddl specs.

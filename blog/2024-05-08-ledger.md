## High level summary

Some of the most important and final Conway features were implemented since the last report:

* Bootstrap phase is fully implemented
* `HardForkInitiaztion` governance action will now correctly take us into the next era
  that will follow the Conway era.
* DRep stake distribution now also includes the amount in the reward account and deposits
  that were left for the governance proposals.
* `CostModels` updates for plutus scripts made more flexible, which will allow us adding
  new primitives for all plutus versions starting with the Conway era.

As always, besides new features, we also wrote a lot of testing functionality. We now have
our first and fully functional conformance test for a `GOV` rule, with a few more in the
works. Many improvements and bugfixes to constraint based generating functionality. Last,
but not least, we did a major and long awaited improvement to our CI setup that makes it
much easier to spot failing tests and deal with potential flakiness.

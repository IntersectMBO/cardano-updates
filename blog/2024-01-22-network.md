## High level overview of [sprint 53][sprint-53]

We integrated bootstrap peers with `cardano-node` in an experimental branch
([cardano-node-5485], [ouroboros-network-4615]). We continued working on
`tx-submission`: [ouroboros-network-3311].

Karl Knutsson (CF) worked on peer sharing improvements: [ouroboros-network-4778].

Erik de Castro Lopo made `ouroboros-network` packages compile with `GHC-9.8`:
[ouroboros-network-4727].

Nick Frisby (Tweag, Consensus Team), modified `local-state-query` mini-protocol
so that one can acquire the immutable tip and thus get information which is not
subject to rollbacks: [ouroboros-network-4765].

## Low level summary

Other, less significant changes / improvements include:

* we helped diagnose `TVar` memory leak when using `ghc-9.8`.  This will
  require more work from us in the near future, see [ouroboros-network-4776];
* we fixed a minor issues with `block-size` in `ouroboros-network`:
  [ouroboros-network-4775];
* we changed pipelining depth configuration to use `Word16` (thanks to Eric de
  Castro Lopo): [ouroboros-network-4774];
* we changed pipelining depth QuickCheck generator: [ouroboros-network-4771];
* we moved `configureOutboundConnection` to `ouroboros-network` as a private
  function: [ouroboros-network-4773];
* we updated copyright information of network packages: [Win32-network-27],
  [ouroboros-network-4761];
* we merged a PR which added a test which could discover the bug fixed in
  [ouroboros-network-4748], see [ouroboros-network-4757].

## High level summary
The open fronts that the crypto team is working on are:
* Mithril: Updated KES crate to force user to allocate buffer of bytes for the key. Include proper testing for batch mtree opening and STM batch verify. Progressed with RFP for audit.
* cardano-base: BLS branch is now ready for review. We are workign forward its merge. 
* KES agent: time off of part of the team, but in general continuing with the adaptation of the KES agent with consensus codebase.
* Sidechains: We are exploring and starting discussion on how sidechains could leverage BLS12-381 bindings for SNARKs
## Low level summary
### Mithril
* Bumped to version [0.2.0](https://crates.io/crates/kes-summed-ed25519/0.2.0) the implementation of KES. Redesigned the representation of the secret key to allow user to allocate a buffer using `mlock`.
* Opened [PR#783](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/783) to update dependency
* Improved testing for batch opening of mtree, [PR#773](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/773)
* Improved testing for batch verification of STM sigs [PR#774](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/774)
* RFP for crypto audit almost ready.
### cardano-base
* BLS12-381 branch finally ready for review [PR#266](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/266)
### KES agent
Team off for one week. Other progress:
- Learning about raw direct-bearer abstraction. An interface for sockets in consensus.
- use that for direct ser/deser
- written those syntaxes for ouroboros (coming PR)
- the kes agent will depend on that. 	
### Sidechains
Progress with familiarisation of Halo2 library to write circuits.

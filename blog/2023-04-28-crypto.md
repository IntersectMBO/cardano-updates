## High level summary
The open fronts that the crypto team is working on are:
* cardano-base: New KES structure finally merged. Included additional tests to BLS, and including test vectors created with zkcrypto's library.
* KES agent: Reaching state of MVP. Rewriting KES agent networking code to use the Snockets abstraction.
* Sidechains: Started implementing ECC chip of JubJub over BLS12-381.
## Low level summary
### cardano-base
* [#255](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/255) finally merged :tada:
* Additional tests for BLS bindings [#384](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/384)
* Open PR for including test vectors created with [zkscrypto](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381)'s library, [PR#397](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/397)
### KES agent
* Introducing the SignKeyWithPeriodKES wrapper type, which bundles a KES key with its corresponding KES period [PR#389](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/389).
* Introducing the DirectSerialise API into cardano-base, which allows us to write mlocked memory directly to a file descriptor, without going through intermediate encodings stored on the GHC heap (which is a no-no due to secure forgetting requirements) [#317](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/317).
* Figuring out how to generalize the KES, DSIGN, and mlocking code in cardano-base such that it can run in IOSim
* Rewriting KES agent networking code to use the Snockets abstraction, which gives us a platform-independent sockets layer (i.e., it will also work on Windows), and also allows us to run networked code in IOSim for testing purposes
* Refactor MonadSodium into MonadMLock [PR#388](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/388).
### Sidechains
* Started working on ECC chip for JubJub over BLS (problems still with the multiplication constraint)
* Use macros used by PSE library to try and merge our fork of halo2curves into PSE's repo

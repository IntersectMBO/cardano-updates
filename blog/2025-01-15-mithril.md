## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team activated the certification of the Cardano stake distribution for the mainnet, and upgraded all the Mithril networks to the Cardano node v.10.1.4. They also continued implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database: they completed the artifacts creation and synchronization engine, completed the digests route for the incremental Cardano database in the aggregator REST API, and started working on the cloud synchronization of the artifacts.

Finally, they enhanced the golden tests implementations of the messages, worked on the split of the mithril-common crate, and they investigated a bug in the client on Windows Power Shell.

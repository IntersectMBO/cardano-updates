## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team made progress in adapting the Mithril client library for WASM compilation and providing a JavaScript API for it. They also completed the optimization of the aggregator's performance. Additionally, the team initiated the implementation of a testing Mithril network for SanchoNet and conducted threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking.

Finally, they enhanced the developer experience of the Mithril client library by providing ready to run examples in the repsoitory, and they implemented a workflow to manually publish libraries on crates.io.

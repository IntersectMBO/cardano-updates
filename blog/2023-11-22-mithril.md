## High level overview


This week, the Mithril team made progress in decentralizing the Mithril networks with the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking proof of concept, completing the first prototype implementation of the Mithril relay, which enables P2P signature broadcasting. They also made progress in optimizing the performance of the aggregator. Additionally, the team completed some enhancements on the CI/CD that will help manually deploy experimental Mithril networks for SanchoNet, as well as for the new P2P network layer.

Finally, they investigated occasional runtime issues causing delays for certain SPOs and started preparing for the next distribution release.

## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* An on-going, intermittent outage with our nix upstream cache storage provider
has been investigated.  While the issue still persists and we work with the
provider to get it resolved, it appears to be isolated to traffic routing
through a particular provider colocation.  Installing a wireguard tunnel for
our cache traffic to route around the affected colo has brought our build farm
machines back to normal operation until the provider resolves the issue.

This biweekly is shorter than usual as SRE members attended Nixcon 2025 to stay
sharp on nix skills, relevant technical knowledge and tooling that can benefit
our IOE environments and operations.  Additionally, the remaining time was
skewed towards internal operations rather than feature development during this
period.  A new team member has also joined the SRE team!


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Devx-ci
* Adds an independent pin for GH runner bumps, and adds use of an r2 wg tunnel
  to eu-central-1 to work around the problematic CF ARN colo reads.

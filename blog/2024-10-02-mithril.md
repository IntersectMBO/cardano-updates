## High level overview

The Mithril team continued working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. They completed the development of a mechanism to support specific configurations for signing Cardano transactions and kept implementing the autonomous computation of the messages to be signed by the signer. They also activated the certification of the Cardano transactions on the `release-mainnet` network.

Finally, they started creating a new Mithril era and prepared to upgrade to Cardano node version `9.2.1`.

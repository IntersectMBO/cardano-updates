## High level summary

The ledger team made great progress in advancing Conway era forward. In particular, voting
for DRep and Stake Pool Operators is now at the state that can be used by downstream
components. Addition of new ledger state queries makes it possible to verify changes to
the governance state, such as placement of votes, submission of governance proposals,
inspecting DRep stake distribution and more. Addition of treasury withdrawals concludes the
ability to enact all of the governance actions, except for the hard fork initiation.

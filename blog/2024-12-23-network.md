## Overview of [sprint 77][sprint-77]

### Initiator only mode for local roots

We implemented the initiator-only mode for local roots peers described in
[ouroboros-network#5020].  This feature will be available in
`cardano-node-10.3` ([cardano-node#6055]).

One will be able to specify `diffusionMode` (either `InitiatorOnly` or
`IntiatorAndRespoinder`, the latter is the default) for all local roots in
a given local roots group, e.g.

```json
{ "localRoots":
    [ { "accessPoints":
          [ { "address": "10.0.0.1"
            , "port": 3001
            }
          ]
      , "advertise": false
      , "diffusionMode": "InitiatorOnly"
      , "warmValency": 1
      , "hotValency": 1
      }
    , { "accessPoints":
          [ { "address": "10.0.0.2"
            , "port": 3001
            }
          ]
      , "advertise": true
      , "diffusionMode": "InititiatorAndResponder"
      , "warmValency": 1
      , "hotValency": 1
      }
    ]
, "publicRoots": []
, "useLedgerAfterSlot": -1
}
```

As part of [ouroboros-network#5020] we had to change how connections are
identified in the simulated testnet environment.  We exposed
`ConnStateIdSupply` through P2P interfaces, which allows us to use a global
`ConnStateIdSupply` for all nodes in the simulation. This way, `ConnStateId` is
unique for each connection in the simulation. See [ouroboros-network#5026].

### Support systems with multiple IP addresses

We merged [ouroboros-network#5017] which allows to run `cardano-node` on
systems with multiple network interfaces or a single interface with multiple IP
addresses.

### Reusable diffusion

We were working on early integration of reusable diffusion work stream with
`ouroboros-consensus` & `cardano-node`.   Reusable diffusion will allow us to
support both `cardano-node` and `mithril-node` in the future. We are 
pleased to say that we are running a `cardano-node` that uses
refactored diffusion. See:

* [design notes][reusable-diffusion]
* issue: [ouroboros-network#4929]

### Tx-Submission Logic

We had a discussion with the consensus team (Karl Knutsson [CF], Nick Frisby
[Tweag]) on network requirements for `tx-mempool`. See:

* issue: [ouroboros-network#3311]
* pr: [ouroboros-network#4887]
* [ouroboros-network#4984] (Karl's changes on top of [ouroboros-network#4887])

### SRV record support

We continued working on the SRV support, see:
* issue: [ouroboros-network#2883]
* pr: [ouroboros-network#5018]

### Technical Debt

We renamed some of the test modules to be more consistent across various
network components, see [ouroboros-network#5028].

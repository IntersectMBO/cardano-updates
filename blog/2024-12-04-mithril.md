## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database. They completed the computation of the message to sign and started working on creating and synchronizing the artifacts. The team also continued exploring solutions for signer registration in networks with multiple aggregators and progressed on developing a cache for certificate verification in the WASM client.

Finally, they implemented a retry mechanism in the end-to-end tests within the CI to address flakiness and investigated methods to track the origin of client requests.

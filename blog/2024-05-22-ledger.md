## High level summary

Most of the focus was on the conformance testing this time around. We had completed
conformance tests for `CERT` and `RATIFY` rules and progressed on some of the others. This
also resulted in some improvements to the `constraint-generators` framework. Besides that
we've also fixed Stake Pool Operator stake distribution calculation that is used for
voting by including proposal deposits that are currently locked in the system. One of the
Ledger team members was also performing duties of a release engineer, so we also
facilitated the latest `cardano-node-8.11` release.

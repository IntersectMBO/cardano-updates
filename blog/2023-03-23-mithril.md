## High level overview
The Mithril team released a new [`2310.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2310.0) distribution that activates the era switch mechanism. They also kept implementing the migration of the aggregator stores to a relational design with the first adaptation of the stake pool store, and then the adaptation of the epoch settings & signed entity type stores. They have implemented the handling of the network API version from the Open API specifications and its automatic switch at era transition. Additionally, they optimized the stake distribution computation that now happens only once per epoch, and also enhanced the client multi-platform workflow to test the Docker images.

Finally, they have successfully completed the tests to create certificates and snapshots on a network running on the Cardano `mainnet` and they have fixed some bugs.

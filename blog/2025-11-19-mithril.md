## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team completed the first phase of decentralizing configuration parameters and made good progress on implementing a simple aggregator discovery mechanism. Additionally, they kept working on the SNARK-friendly STM library by designing its architecture, implementing the Schnorr signature scheme, refactoring error handling, and experimenting with a Jubjub curve implementation in the BLST library.

Finally, they fixed some bugs, made enhancements to the CI, and continued improving the protocol security page.

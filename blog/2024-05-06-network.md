## High-level overview of [sprint 60][sprint-60]

### Peer-Sharing Improvements

We continued working on improving peer sharing.  As part of this work light
peer sharing (e.g. including inbound peers to the known set of outbound
governor), was restructured.  Now, sending more peers than what was requested by
the peer-sharing client is a protocol error, and the connection will be terminated;
This hasn't been a resource attack vector since we always limited the number of
peers taken by the `outbound-governor` and the number of peers has always been
limited by the size of the mux ingress queue reserved for peer-sharing
mini-protocol.  These changes will be released in `cardano-node-8.9.3`.  See
[ouroboros-network#4868]

We also merged the work on outbound governor counters, which initially started
as just an extension for peer-sharing counters but turned into a larger
refactorisation.  We announced it in the previous report.  These changes won't
be included in `8.9.3`.  See [ouroboros-network#4845],
[ouroboros-network#4861].

Light peer sharing (inbound peers) refactorisation allowed us to refactor the
inbound governor loop: we restructured it so that the internal state is kept
pure (and thus not shared with other threads), while the public part is
computed incrementally (with good amortised costs and thus leading to good performance) and exposed to other
components (e.g. the `outbound-governor`), see [ouroboros-network#4871] \(which
is built on top of [ouroboros-network#4868]).

### Genesis

We implemented the API needed by the consensus layer for `Genesis`; see
[ouroboros-network#4815], [ouroboros-network#4846]. 

We continued working on outbound governor changes to support `Genesis`:

* [ouroboros-network#3396]
* [ouroboros-network#4813] 
* [ouroboros-network#4849] 

### Bootstrap Peers

Karl Knutsson ([CF]) found and fixed some problems related to big-ledger and
public root peers.  Here's an excerpt from the changelog file:
* updated the big-ledger retry state in case of an exception;
* reset public root retry state when transitioning between `LedgerStateJudgements`;
* reduced public root retry timer;
* don't classify a config file with public-root/bootstrap-peers IP addresses only
  as a DNS error. 
See [ouroboros-network#4867].

### Churn

We merged a refactorisation which synchronises churn with the outbound
governor, see [ouroboros-network#4617].

## Minor Improvements

A few other minor improvements were merged:

* updated tools used by `nix`, see [ouroboros-network#4860];
* updated pull request template, see [ouroboros-network#4862]

### Testing

We added `quickcheck-monoids` package and also submitted an upstream patch to
`QuickCheck` to include a version of the standard [`All`] / [`Any`] monoids, which
are helpful when writing more complex properties.  We will use
`quickcheck-monoids` until the upstream PR will be released.  It will be
available from [CHaP]. See [quickcheck#397].

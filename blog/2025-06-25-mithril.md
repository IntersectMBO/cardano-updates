## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team focused on implementing the publisher and consumer for the DMQ network using the `n2c local message submission` and `n2c local message notification` mini-protocols from the Pallas library. The team also focused on stabilizing the Cardano database v2 backend within the Mithril client CLI and library. Additionally, they initiated the implementation of certificate chain synchronization in the follower aggregator and successfully completed refactoring the `mithril-common` crate.

Finally, they started upgrading the repository to Rust 2024 edition and continued refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

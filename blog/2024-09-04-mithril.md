## High level overview

The Mithril team kept working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. In this preliminary phase, they began implementing a buffer store for individual signatures that may arrive before being processed by an aggregator. Additionally, they moved the broadcast of signer registrations to the aggregatorâ€™s epoch settings route. The team also monitored the Chang upgrade to ensure the Mithril networks operated correctly and cleaned up unnecessary code. Additionally, they implemented a seamless transition from unstable to stable features in the WASM client.

Finally, the team activated a feature allowing the selection of the arithmetic backend used by Mithril cryptography in the client and refactored the organization of signer dependencies.

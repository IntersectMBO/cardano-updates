## High level overview

The Mithril team kept working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. In this preliminary phase, they have started implementing a buffer store for individual signatures which could arrive in advance to an aggregator and they have moved signer registrations broadcast to the aggregator's epoch settings route. They also followed-up on the Chang upgrade to make sure the Mithril networks worked properly and to tidy up some code which is not necessary anymore. Additionally, they implemented seamless transition from unstable to stable features in the WASM client.

Finally, they have activated a feature to select the arithmetic backend used by Mithril cryptography in the client, and they have refactored the signer dependencies organization.

## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on cardano environment improvements and general environment maintenance.

Some notable recent updates or improvements include:
* Work on cardano-parts repo continues and was utilized by the sanchonet-demo repository for demonstration purposes
* Work on a new [capkgs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/capkgs) repository started -- "Content Addressed Packages"
  * This repository provides common Cardano release and pre-release binaries in a pure content addressed nix package type via flake output
  * These packages don't have the associated IFD, long eval times and large source dependencies that the originating source repositories often do
  * Consumers of such packages, such as devShells or nixos machines, can benefit from the improved performance this offers

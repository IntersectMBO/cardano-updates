## High level summary

This week we managed to integrate in the node the Consensus version of the UTxO-HD prototype that features the second version of the Ledger DB API.
We also [changed the epoch structure for Conway](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/pull/927), made progress towards the Bootstrap State Machine and Peras planning.
On the support front, we are investigating the impact of snapshots on missed leadership checks.

## High level summary

This past two weeks saw many months worth of ledger changes integrated with the `cardano-base`
and `ouroboros-network` repositories.
The vast majority of the effort involved all the changes to the ledger serialization libraries
(and the interplay with `cardano-base`) which now support proper versioning.
Supporting the conway ledger era, and in particular allowing the ledger state to transition
to a whole new system of governance, also played a noticeable part in the integration.

Besides the integration work, the team continues to address technical debt, improve the
documentation, make our testing infrastructure better (such as experimenting with better
nightly tests), and formally specifying more parts of CIP-1694.

## Lower level summary

### Integration work

Below is all the integration work completed, which will enable a release to node from
the current ledger master. Many thanks to
[Alexey](https://github.com/lehins) for this colossal undertaking!

* [pull-3303]
* [pull-3302]
* [pull-3300]
* [pull-3299]
* [pull-3298]
* [pull-3297]
* [pull-3292]
* [pull-3289]
* [pull-3288]
* [pull-3279]
* [pull-3282]
* [pull-4349]

### Technical debt

Starting in major protocol version 9, zero-valued multi-assets will no longer be permitted
in the CBOR specification. See [pull-3241].

We now have our `.cabal` files being checked for a consistent formatting given by
`cabal format` in our CI. See [pull-3286].

We are still experimenting with better nightly tests for our long running
property based tests. See [pull-3276] and [pull-3296].

### Small documentation improvements

The hand proofs of the preservation ADA property have been added back to the
Shelley ledger specification. See [pull-3295].

We have clarified how the script integrity hash is computed in the CDDL description.
See [pull-3290].

### Specifying CIP-1694

Our new formal specifications backed by Agda have seen a lot of progress!
Upgrading to Agda 2.6.3 fixed our main build infrastructure problems,
and we no longer have to rely on our custom fork. See [pull-50].

Our progress on formally specifying CIP-1694 can be followed here:
* in Agda: [pull-40]
* the corresponding Haskell: [pull-3291]

### Constraint based testing

We are still actively working on our new constraint based property testing framework.
We have nearly all of the constraints for an entire ledger state
hooked into generators, and tests that the generators do indeed obey the constraints.
The variable count in the constraints is over 100!
There is still much work to do on shrinking, making the generators faster,
and writing actual property tests for the ledger, but the approach still seems viable and
we are hopeful that it could replace our trace generators.
The WIP can be followed here: [pull-3219].

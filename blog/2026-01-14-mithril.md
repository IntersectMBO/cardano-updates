## High level overview

The Mithril team focused on implementing the SNARK-friendly STM library and began developing the non-recursive SNARK circuit MVP within it. They completed the preparation phase of the SNARK circuit by assessing infrastructure costs, the audit status of the Midnight ZK library, and detecting an under-constrained circuit. They also kept working on the prototype of the recursive SNARK circuit.

Additionally, the team completed the DMQ infrastructure implementation and prepared for its deployment. They prepared a new guide for setting up an aggregator and published two development blog posts about the upcoming DMQ testing program with SPOs and the multiple aggregators testing program.

Finally, they switched to Blockfrost API to fetch the SPO tickers and names in the aggregator, and fixed issues in the CI related to disk space in runners.

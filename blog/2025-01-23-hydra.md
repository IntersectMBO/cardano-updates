### High-level summary

The last few weeks have seen us finialising a copule of things; notably our
experiments into running Hydra with a custom ledger (to support, for example,
    a custom plutus script operation you may be interested in). We have almost
wrapped up incremental commits; just finishing the spec changes. We will then
focus on a release, and some features that users have been wanting for a while
around memory usage and resilience.

### What did the team achieve?

* Completed custom ledger experiment [#1727](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1727), [#1742](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1742#issuecomment-2605023483), [#1796](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1796)
* Restored hydra-explorer for 0.19 [#12](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra-explorer/pull/12)
* Add deposit deadline command-line option [#1798](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1798)
* Researched options for less-than-totaly consensus in a Hydra Head

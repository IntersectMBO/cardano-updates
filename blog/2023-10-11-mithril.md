## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team has worked on the distribution of the Mithril client as a library that will be distributed on [crates.io](https://crates.io/), the Rust dependencies repository. The team has also worked on computing deterministically the transactions history of an address from the immutable files. Additionally, they have started to fix a bottleneck in the aggregator that limits the ingestion of signatures.

Finally, they kept working on the activation of Cloudflare on the infrastructure and fixed some bugs in the Nix CI.

### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team fixed the `gen-hydra-keys` command to avoid
overwriting existing keys, and resolved issues related to the rewritten
`hydra-tui`. They also worked on a \"dirt road\" implementation for the
\"Ignored init tx\" notification, improving the robustness of the system.

The team finalized preparations for the Cardano Summit presentation, including
implementation of the `hydra-poll` example DApp.

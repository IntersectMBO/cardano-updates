## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* An Oakhost cloud Mac M4 machine was on-boarded into the mixed Hetzner and
prem Darwin CI environment. An internal documentation guide was written for
fast Oakhost onboarding if a need to scale Darwin resources further presents
itself.

* [Adawallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adawallet) received a feature
upgrade to to handle native tokens in a number of subcommands for adawallet
accounts. The [cardano-airgap](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-airgap)
image was updated to include this capability.

* A new IOHK signing authority key for email `signing.authority@iohk.io` with
GPG key fingerprint ending in `0xCD0171BC90`, was placed into production for
package signing.  The public key can be found
[here](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x31b3f22fa0cce2e8382c04a2807f2acd0171bc90).

## Repository Work -- Merged

### Adawallet
* Adds multiasset support to adawallet in select contexts such as `send-tx`,
  `drain-tx`, `bulk-drain-tx`, `migrate-wallet`, `import-utxos`, `export-utxos`.
  When the multiasset option is used native tokens are aggregated into a single
  UTXO with the minimum amount of lovelace required and lovelace only UTXOs are
  handled separately. A future improvement would be to handle large native tokens
  collections which may hit transaction size limits.

### Cardano-airgap
* Adds adawallet multiasset support per Adawallet PR#24.
  [cardano-airgap-pr-7](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-airgap/pull/7)


### Devx-ci
* Adds `oak-m4-1` machine to the build cluster with associated monitoring,
  secrets, hydra ssh and build machine defn.  Updates `darwin.sh` with a `-b,
  --bindir` optional arg to allow an easier darwin bootstrapping deployment.
  Bumps opentofu grafana provider to `4.5.3`, makes a common Hetzner linux
  module, smaller Hetzner linux variant specific modules and refactors the
  existing Hetzner linux machines under those. Moves `hetzner-m1.nix` to
  `darwin-state-version.nix` module used by both Hetzner and Oakhost darwin
  machines. Adds a few clarification comments to the distributed builds
  nixosModule.
  [devx-ci-pr-133](https://github.com/input-output-hk/devx-ci/pull/133)


### Ops-lib
* Bumps devShell and machines nix to `2.29.1`, bumps deployed machines to
  nixpkgs `25.05` with a small patch for nixops to continue operating, bumps
  iohk-nix to current head and niv to latest sources.nix. Cleans up the ssh key
  overlay and removes sentry relevant package, modules and scripts as usage is
  deprecated.  Makes misc required nixos-25.05 nixpkgs module updates.

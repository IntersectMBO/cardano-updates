## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* A sanchonet relay and pool have been spun up to participate in the community
driven disaster recovery testing happening in the near future.

* Cardano-submit-api configs will be updated to be compatible with both the
legacy and new tracing system in the next cardano-node release.

* A legacy Matomo deployment is being migrated to a newer stack so deprecated
resources can be turned off in the near future.


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Capkgs
* Adds an `exclusions.json` file to exclude packages that are known to not
  build, with compatibility code added to `packages.cr` and a new justfile
  recipe: `filter-packages`. The exclusions file was populated with all
  currenctly failing evals along with a reason. Go package exclusions were
  re-added after the missing hydra go deps were re-cached after working around a
  failing test certificate during haskell.nix bootstrap tests.

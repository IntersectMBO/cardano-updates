## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team focused on the SNARK-friendly STM library, completing its architecture design, refactoring error handling, and implementing the Schnorr signature scheme. They also made good progress preparing the specifications for the non-recursive SNARK circuit, prototyping the recursive SNARK solution, and experimenting with a Jubjub curve implementation in the BLST library.

Additionally, they continued implementing a simple aggregator discovery mechanism, worked on improvements to the protocol security page, and enhanced the end-to-end tests to better support the introduction of new features.

Finally, they fixed an incident with certification that stopped on mainnet and preview networks, and started upgrading to Cardano node v.10.6.

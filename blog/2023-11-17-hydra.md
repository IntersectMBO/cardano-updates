## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team made several impactful updates. They addressed
misleading errors regarding collect com transactions, resolved a security
advisory (CVE-2023-42806), and simplified the Hydra Head protocol by using
inline datums. The team also tackled minor inconsistencies in specifications and
implementation, documented reasons for potentially dropped close transactions by
the cardano-node, and collaborated with SundaeLabs on an offline mode for
`hydra-node`. Additionally, they engaged in discussions with researchers about
incremental de-/commits.

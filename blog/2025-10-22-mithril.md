## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued to implement the first phase of decentralizing the configuration parameters. They also completed enhancements to the client library and CLI, providing access to Cardano database incremental snapshots by epoch. Additionally, they kept working on the design of the snarkification of the certificates.

Finally, the team added a section about compatibility with the Cardano node in the GitHub release notes and worked on adapting to the security changes for NPM package publication.

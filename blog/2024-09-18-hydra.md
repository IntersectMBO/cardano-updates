### High-level summary

We released 0.19.0 of the hydra-node, where the ledger has been upgraded to
Conway, while still maintaining compatibility with Babbage transactions. We
made some small improvements to the TUI, and did some investigations into a
"Head-In-Head"-style operation of hydra, where one Head can be used to launch
another. This isn't supported officially yet, but we will be considering it in
the future. Up next we will continue on incremental commits, work towards a
Blockfrost chain layer, and continue investigations into our core networking,
and finally spend some time planning some potential upcoming Hydra
Doom-related work.

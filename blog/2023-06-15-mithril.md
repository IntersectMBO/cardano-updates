## High level overview
The Mithril team completed the implementation of the new sub-command for restoring a Mithril stake distribution in the client. They also updated the clientâ€™s developer documentation and architecture documentation, and did some refactoring on the client and its dependency injection mechanism. Additionally, they completed and deployed infrastructure enhancements on the test Mithril networks. They also completed the performance tests of the new stake distribution computation on the Cardano mainnet.

Finally, the team worked on fixing a bug on the client multi-platform test, a bug on the aggregator state machine, and some flakiness on the CI.

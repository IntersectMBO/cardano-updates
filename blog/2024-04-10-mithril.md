## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They focused on scaling the signature and proof generation for `mainnet`, completed the incremental storage of transactions, activated the signature of the transactions on the `testing-preview` network, and prepared a new network to test the scaling on `mainnet` data. The team also made progress on a prototype for decentralizing signer registration with the relay and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Additionally, they worked on refactoring the database providers of the aggregator.

Finally, the team delivered a community requested feature that displays the minimum versions of the Cardano node that the signer supports in a machine-readable format. They also provided a manual setup guide for the relay in the SPO user guide.

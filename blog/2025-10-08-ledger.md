## High level summary

This period Ledger team has progressed further with [`CIP-112`](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0112) implementation, in particular we've defined a new type of native script that allows enforcing a plutus script to be executed as part of transaction validation. Besides that we've made some improvents to the Ledger interface for downstream users, put some effort into test suite organization and applied some fixes to our CI/CD configuration.

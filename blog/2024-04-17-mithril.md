## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They worked on scaling the signature and proof generation for `mainnet` with the compression of the transaction Merkle tree by using sub-Merkle trees of transactions by block ranges. They also made progress in designing low latency certification, investigated a memory leak in the signature/proof process, and worked on retrieving the tip of the chain with the Pallas chain observer. The team almost completed the prototype for decentralizing signer registration with the relay and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Additionally, they completed the refactoring of the database providers of the aggregator and re-span the `testing-sanchonet` network following the release of Cardano node `8.10.0-pre`.

Finally, the team made some optimizations on the compilation of their pre-built binaries in order to fix panics occuring on CPUs without ADX instructions, and created a networks configuration file on the repository to facilitate automatic compatibility checks.

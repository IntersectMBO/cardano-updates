## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Cardano-node `10.6.0` has been pre-released with the corresponding long
running SRE PRs now merged into this release!  See the
[release notes](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/10.6.0)
for details.

* SRE team identified a ledger replay bug in the `10.6.0` release candidate
whereby the legacy tracing system would no longer log ledger replay update
statistics.  A fix was implemented prior to tagging and pre-releasing.

* Near the end of this biweekly reporting period, the preview network experienced
a network partition.  After an intense multi-team and community collaborative
effort which the SRE team was participating in from the beginning, the bug
causing the partition was identified and a new cardano-node version `10.5.2`
was released to fix the issue.  This version was deployed to the IOE preview
machines immediately upon release and shortly afterwards to the rest of the IOE
testnet and mainnet infra.

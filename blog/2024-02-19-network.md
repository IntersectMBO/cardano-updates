## High-level overview of [sprint 55][sprint-55]

This sprint the networking was nominated for the Cardano Release Engineer role and
we've been working on the integration of bootstrap peers with `cardano-node`.  This
is a work in progress: [cardano-node-5485].  `cardano-node-8.9` will be the first
node which supports the bootstrap peers feature, but we anticipate additional
improvements needed before this is used at scale.

We disabled mean reward for new peers in the churn mechanism which was hurting
connection in remote destinations.  Thanks to [Karl Knutsson] ([CF]) for
providing evidence and a patch.  In future, this mechanism will be further
changed, but this requires more analysis.  [ouroboros-network#4800]

We continued working on `tx-submission`, [ouroboros-network#3311]

We welcome [Marcin Wojciechowski][crocodile-dentist] as part of the Networking
Team of Cardano Core Tech.  He reviewed our documentation as part of his
onboarding process: [ouroboros-network#4802].

[Andrew Westberg] ([DripDropz]) corrected documentation regarding which
`node-to-node` protocol version introduced `P2P`.

## Low-level summary

* We fixed an issue related to local root peers related to bootstrap peers: [ouroboros-network#4799].

## Open Source Contributions

### IOSim

We released [`io-sim-1.4.1.0`] with some new features & improvements:

* QuickCheck monadic combinators: [io-sim#140].
* Provide `PrimMonad` instance: [io-sim#141], thanks to [Duncan Coutts] ([Well-Typed]).

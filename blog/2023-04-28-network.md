## High level summary

The networking team has released the following packages to `Hackage`:

* [`io-classes`],
* [`io-classes-mtl`]
* [`io-sim`],
* [`strict-stm`],
* [`strict-mvar`]

We published an announcement [blog post][io-sim-blog-post].  We made progress
also on another blog post which will describes the design of the P2P networking
layer.

After moving `ouroboros-consensus` to its own repository, we made
`ouroboros-network` compatible with `GHC` `9.4` and `9.6`.

We made `cardano-client` library independent of
`ouroboros-consensus-diffusion`.

We prepared release of network packages for `cardano-node-8.0`.

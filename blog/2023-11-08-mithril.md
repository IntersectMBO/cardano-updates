## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept working on the adaptation of the Mithril client as a library which is almost completed. They kept working on decentralizing the Mithril networks with the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking proof of concept, for which they have achieved the implementation of a very basic working demo with a peer-to-peer pubsub mechanism. Additionally, the team kept working on the deterministic computation of the UTxO/transactions set from the immutable files.

Finally, they fixed the name of the Docker package that stores images of the new Mithril client CLI, and they kept fixing some performance issue on the `release-mainnet` aggregator.

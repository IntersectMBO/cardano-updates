## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the initial version of the [Mithril client NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mithril-dev/mithril-client-wasm), enabling developers to integrate core Mithril features into their web applications running in a browser. They also released a new distribution, [`2403.1`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2403.1), which includes support for Cardano node version `8.7.3`, a new chain observer based on the [Pallas](https://crates.io/crates/pallas) library, along with bug fixes and performance improvements.

The team kept implementing a new entity type for certifying the Cardano transactions set in Mithril networks and made good progress on retrieving transactions and combining them into a Mithril protocol message. Additionally, they finished implementing a mock aggregator and using it in the browser tests for the Mithril client in WASM.

Finally, they worked on enhancing node communications between Mithril and Cardano, and they continued working on threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking.

## High level overview

This year, the Mithril team continues to prioritize protocol decentralization through the DMQ network, broader protocol adoption, and the introduction of succinct proofs by evolving the STM library with SNARKs.

This week, they focused on implementing the SNARK-friendly STM library, kept developing the non-recursive SNARK circuit MVP within it, and started working on the pre-aggregation SNARK primitives. They also kept working on the prototype of the recursive SNARK circuit.

Additionally, the team prepared for the deployment of the DMQ network by finalizing its infrastructure and node implementation.

Finally, they worked on documenting a proposal to make Mithril and DMQ opt-out features of Cardano, and continued updating the protocol security page.

## High level overview

The Mithril team finished their work on the certification of Cardano stake distribution. They completed the implementation of the client library, the client CLI and the client npm package. The draft CIP for the diffusion of Mithril signatures through the Cardano network has been created as a PR on the [CIPs repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/876). Additionally, they have implemented a mechanism in the client which helps supporting evolutive configuration options, and they started working on a proof-of-concept for implementing the signature diffusion with the Cardano network layer.

The team also created a new runbook in the documentation and worked on external contributions to the repository.

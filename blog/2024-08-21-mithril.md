## High level overview

The Mithril team has completed their work on certifying Cardano's stake distribution. They implemented the client library, client CLI, and client NPM package. Additionally, they drafted a CIP for the diffusion of Mithril signatures through the Cardano network, which is available in a PR on the [CIPs repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/876). 

They also implemented a mechanism in the client to support evolutive configuration options and initiated a proof of concept for integrating signature diffusion with the Cardano network layer. Finally, they created a new runbook in the documentation and made progress on external contributions to the repository.

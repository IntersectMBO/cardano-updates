## High-level overview of [sprint 43][sprint-43]

In this sprint, we received contributions from [CF] & [Galois].  Karl Knutsson
([CF]) has addressed various issues regarding peer churning in P2P, timeouts
and our `WireShark` dissector.  While the [Galois] developers focused on
addressing issues from their review last year. See below for more details.

We continued working on bootstrap peers [ouroboros-network-#4661].

We refactored our test suites: they are split into `io-tests` which require to
be run natively on all platforms (these tests mostly contain tests that
require `IO` system calls) and `sim-tests` which are platform independent.  We
run `io-tests` on all supported platforms (e.g. `x86_64-linux`,
`x86-64-darwin`, `aarch64-darwin` and `x86_64-w64-mingw32` (Windows)) natively.
The `sim-tests` are not executed on `Windows` due to memory limitations on
GitHub Actions runners. [ouroboros-network-#4653]

We also started rebasing `typed-protocols` refactoring branches.

Marcin was appointed as the `cardano-node` release engineer for the `8.4.0-pre`
version.  So far he integrated `cardano-ledger-conway-1.8` and
`ouroboros-network-0.9.1.0` to `ouroboros-consensus`, `cardano-cli` and
`cardano-api`.  Once we will have an integration branch for `cardano-node`,
`cardano-ledger-conway-1.8` and `ouroboros-consensus` packages can be released
to `CHaP` and PRs can be merged once they go through review & CI.

We also fixed some smaller issues regarding peer sharing (both were discovered
by Karl from [CF]). More details are included below.

### Progress on P2P addoption

#### SPO relays

There are currently ~2000 relays running P2P
enabled nodes that belong to 557 pools with a combined stake of 7900Mil Ada. On
16th of August it was ~1700 relays, 531 pools with a combined stake of 7700Mil
Ada.

The following graphs show several different versions of relays running on the mainnet.  The
green line `NodeToNodeVersionV10.True` denotes P2P relays, which slowly
increase over time.  The `V9` and earlier versions of the `node-to-node`
the protocol indicates nodes version `1.35.x` or earlier.

Data has been kindly provided by [CF] and their mainnet monitoring
infrastructure.

#### IOG relays

As of this week, 90% of IOG relays are running a P2P setup. In the next sprint all
IOG relays will be running P2P.

## Detailed description

In this sprint, we got a few contributions from [CF]:
* Karl made peer churning mechanism less aggressive [ouroboros-network-#4656]; and
* he added timeouts for idle states in `ChainSync` & `KeepAlive`
  miniprotocols.  These timeouts help a node remove idle connections from the
  responder (server) side [ouroboros-network-#4648].
* he improved the `WireShark` dissector by adding support for the `peer-sharing` mini-protocol [ouroboros-network-#4656].

[Galois] has been making progress in addressing some of the issues they raised in their review (last year):
* Mark Tullsen ([Galois]) has been working on refactoring the main entry function of P2P [ouroboros-network-#4661] (in review);
* Sam Cowger ([Galois]) has been reviewing all use cases of `error` and `unsafe` calls
  [ouroboros-network-#4661] (in review).

## Peer Sharing

* Light peer sharing is only enabled when peer sharing is turned on [ouroboros-network-#4652];
* Handshake incorrectly reports peer sharing value.  It's supposed to relay the
  remote value, but instead, it returns the local value. [ouroboros-network-#4642] (in review).

## Async Demotion Test Fix

* We fixed an async demotion test failure which turned out to be a weakness of
  the test itself rather than a bug in the connection manager. [ouroboros-network-#4655]

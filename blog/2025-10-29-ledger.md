## High level summary

This period marks a very nice milestone for the Ledger team. We have finalized [CIP-118 - Nested Transactions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/862) with drastic simplifications through reliance on [CIP-112 - Observe script type](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/749) and CDDL specification with changes to the transaction. This step puts it in the ready state for the final reviews. Once merged it will conclude the last point on the first milestone listed in the Nested Transaction proposal. Furthermore we have also implemented the distinction between sub-transactions and the top level transaction in such a way that will allow us reuse most of the existing Ledger functionality for transaction validation, regardless of the level. This point takes us right to the finish line of having the second milestone completed as well for the Nested Transaction proposal that was promised by the Ledger team. We expect this milestone to be finalized in the next couple of days.

Beside significant progress on Nested Transactions we have also: implemented a proper solution for preventing invalid serialization for a few obscure edge cases in a transaction, tackled some outstanding tech dept and expanded our test suite.

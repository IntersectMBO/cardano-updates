## High level overview

The Mithril team completed the decentralization of the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. They completed the refactoring the Prometheus metrics in the signer and started implementingg the Prometheus metrics in the aggregator. They also kept working on supporting the new Pythagoras Mithril era. Additionally, they created the new distribution pre-release [2442.0-pre](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2442.0-pre).

Finally, they kept implementing optimizations on the node logs and enhanced the release creation workflow in the CI.

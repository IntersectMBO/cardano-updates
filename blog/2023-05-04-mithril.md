## High level overview
The Mithril team completed the implementation of the new certifier service of the aggregator, which is in charge of producing certificates for multi-signatures. They also finished implementing the interfaces defined to provide certification for the full immutable Cardano files snapshot and the Mithril stake distribution. Additionally, they have completed the refactoring of the multi-signer in the aggregator. The team also fixed the bug in the signer registration that was responsible for gaps during the signature phase for some signers, and they upgraded the Cardano node used in the Mithril testnets and devnet to version `1.35.7`.

Finally, they have worked on designing a decentralized registration for the signers that takes place on the Cardano chain.

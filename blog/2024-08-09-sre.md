### Cardano Parts

[Node 9.1.0, Mithril 2430.0, Chang readiness](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts/pull/45)

#### Overview

Sets cardano-node (release) and cardano-node-ng (pre-release) versions to 9.1.0
and mithril to 2430.0. Includes nixosModule improvements for the new tracing
system, a new template-clone recipe, various recipe improvements and fixes. A
Chang readiness query has been added.

#### Details

* Important versioning updates:
  * cardano-node and cardano-node-ng are now `9.1.0`
* Bumps capkgs:
  * For node releases of `9.1.0`
  * For mithril `2430.0` and mithril-unstable
* Improves the `profile-cardano-node-new-tracing` nixosModule and new tracing system in general by better cleaning residual legacy config items, restructuring the options for more flexibility in config composition, and configuring the new tracing system to log close to parity volume with the legacy tracing system when using UTXO-HD in memory mode.
* Adds additional default Tcp and TcpExt metrics to the `profile-grafana-agent` nixosModules metrics scrape list
* Adds `curl` and the `pre-push` script to the default cardano-parts devShell
* Adds template alert `cardano_node_elevated_restarts`
* Adds a new template recipe of `template-clone` for when downstream users know they simply want to mirror upstream templates rather than diff or patch them
* Adds a new template sql script with a Chang era readiness sql query
* Improves template recipe `dbsync-pool-analyze` and sql query with parameters to query any CTE in the large `dbsync-pool-perf` sql from cli
* Improves template recipe `dbsync-pool-analyze` to handle queries that result in no non-performing pools
* Improves template recipe `dedelegate-pools` with a mempool query instead of a fixed time to handle UTxO on-chain settlement
* Removes template recipes that are now mostly cardano-playground specific
* Fixes template dashboard for cardano-node legacy and new tracing application metrics to always show the full environment KES period
* Fixes template recipe `apply-bootstrap`
* Fixes outdated service option name and db-sync snapshot schema description

* Fixes dashboard for `cardano-node` legacy and new tracing application metrics to always show the full environment KES period


### Cardano-ops (Legacy Mainnet)

[Commit-compare](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ops/compare/50a9825...825d35c)

machines was further reduced by 25%.

### Iohk-nix

[Add conway config for mainnet/preprod/preview](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/pull/586)


### Devx-ci

[Fix Hydra alerting immediately on no data](https://github.com/input-output-hk/devx-ci/commit/8e1eebb6bfaf4f1aa46347564581a3cf08245ec6)

* Migrate from Grafana Cloud to our self-hosted cardano-monitoring stack
  * Do not filter metrics to keep down number of unique series
  * This allows unlimited collection of metrics from our CI machines for better alerts and measurements for ongoing performance tuning.
* Upgrade disko partition names manually on remaining machines ci{2,3,4,6,7,8} so boot does not break on the next deployment
* Grafana dashboard: fix memory usage graph
* Add alerts

### Cardano-monitoring

[Commit-compare](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-monitoring/compare/75b25ad...2c0b022)

* Add preliminary support for Loki for log collection

## Overview of sprints [86][sprint-86], [87][sprint-87] and [88][sprint-88]

### CIP#155

We authored [CIP#155] entitled _SRV Registry_.  This CIP sets up rules for how
decentralised protocols, like Cardano, Mithril, and Hydra, can utilise SRV records.
If you're an SPO or a contributor to a decentralised protocol which relies on
ledger peers, it will be interesting for you. 

We recently started working on making the `ouroboros-network` to be compliant with the proposed [CIP#155].

### cardano-diffusion

We added the `ouroboros-network:cardano-diffusion` sublibrary, which contains
`Cardano` specific instantiation of `ouroboros-network` diffusion.  This is
part of the effort to make `ouroboros-network` a multipurpose library.  See
[PR#5082].

### Mux changes

We made the egress poll configurable; see [PR#5113].  This option will be available
in `cardano-node-10.5` as `EgressPollInterval`.

### Documentation improvements

We reviewed and improved network specification; see [PR#5122].  The changes include:

* timeouts & limits documentation improvements
* ingress buffer size limits
* documented format of Windows named pipes
* tx-submission mini-protocol direction explained
* added links to codec's haddocks
* explained how nodes behind NATs can contribute to the network
* various other improvements

### Releases

We released `ouroboros-network-0.21` and `ouroboros-network-0.21.1`.

We are also pleased to announce that we released [`typed-protocols-0.1.0.0` on
Hackage][typed-protocols-0.1.0.0], as well as
[`io-classes-1.8.0.0`][io-classes-1.8.0.0]

## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Cardano-node `10.5.1` has now been promoted to a [full
release](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/10.5.1) for
mainnet use and has been deployed to all of IOE's node SRE testnet and mainnet
clusters.

* A new docker OCI tag of `10.5.1-docker` is additionally
[available](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pkgs/container/cardano-node/475786153?tag=10.5.1-docker)
for any OCI image users who want to use the `snapshot-converter` binary from
within the image.  The snapshot converter can be found at path
`/usr/local/bin/snapshot-converter`.  New cardano-node OCI release images going
forward will contain the snapshot converter to facilitate ledger backend state
changes without having to rely on host level tooling or a fully ledger replay.

* [Cardano-parameters](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parameters)
is a new repo which maintains the mainnet, preprod and preview protocol
parameters with a daily update, as reported by the
[BlockFrost](https://blockfrost.io/) Cardano API service.

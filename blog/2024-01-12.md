### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team improved Github actions workflows, addressed protocol
parameter schema consistency in hydra-node, and made enhancements to log schema
tests. They created an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for Cardano
transactions serialization in APIs, moved the hydra-chess project to a dedicated
repository, and resolved a bug in quickcheck-dynamic and model tests.

There will be the monthly review meeting with demos on Hydra, Mithril and
related projects. If this sounds interesting, join us in Google Meet
https://meet.google.com/udc-zgyw-agd next week, January 19 2024 at 17:30 UTC.

## High level summary

We implemented the remaining improvements and fixes discovered in Conway, to be fixed during the bootstrap period:
    * protection against deposit loses
    * ensuring that DReps exist before delegating
    * updates to SPO vote threshold calculation
    * improved well-formedness check
Additionally, we added two new rules: Mempool and HardFork, that will allow us to flexibly add processing logic in the future.
We also dropped pointers for Conway and enhanced predicate failure reporting for pre-Conway eras.

Finally, we added more tests - both unit and conformance tests.

## High level summary

This period we've started work on [CIP-112 - Observe script type](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0112) or as we call it in Ledger "Required Guards".
We've also started work on refactoring the stake pool state, in order to accommodate future features and a few performance optimizations.
Besides that we've also put some effort into writing documentation and organizing some of our tests.

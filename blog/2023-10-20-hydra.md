## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team mainly focused on preparing a masterclass and workshop for #CardanoSummit2023.

In addition, they improved the Hydra node API's submit-transaction endpoint to accept three different encoding types: Base16 encoded CBOR string, TextEnvelope type, and JSON.
This improvement offers users greater flexibility and ease of interaction with the API.

Finally, the team has followed up on the TUI brick upgrade to version 1.10.
This effort has resulted in addressing minor details and enhancing the overall user experience with the TUI.

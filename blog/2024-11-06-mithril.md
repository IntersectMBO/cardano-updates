## High level overview

The Mithril team worked on creating the new distribution pre-release [2445.0-pre](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2445.0-pre). Additionally, they completed recording the aggregator metrics in the event store and implemented stable support for Cardano node v.10.1. The team also kept exploring solutions for signer registration when multiple aggregators are running on a Mithril network.

Finally, they implemented a nightly workflow in the CI to check backward compatibility with previous distributions and started implementing a new status route in the aggregator.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the new distribution [`2430.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2430.0) which includes support for Cardano node version `9.1.0`. They activated the certification of Cardano transactions in the `release-preprod` and `pre-release-preview` networks, and also included bug fixes and performance improvements. The team continued their work on the certification of Cardano stake distribution, activated the certification in the test networks, and started working on implementing new routes for the aggregator REST API.. 

Finally, the team benchmarked the signer's footprint on the SPO infrastructure, thoroughly tested edge cases for Cardano transaction certification, and continued drafting a CIP for the diffusion of Mithril signatures through the Cardano network.

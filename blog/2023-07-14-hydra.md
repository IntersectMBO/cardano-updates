## High-level summary

This week the team focused on exploring the event sourced persistence in order
to improve `hydra-node` performance. Because of this work the team noticed we
need to refactor the emit snapshot emission logic and update the spec in the
light of new changes. They also took the time to revisit their goals and product
plans for the next quarter as well as doing some security fixes related to
multisignatures.

## What did the team achieve this week

-   Finished spike about performance improvements of event sourced persistence [#963](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/963).
-   Refactor snapshot emission in protocol logic.
-   Revisited our roadmap and goals.
-   Prepared and conducated a learning session on lean-waste.
-   Improve security of multi-signature checks, see [this Github security advisory](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-c8qp-cv4h-vcc4).
-   Implemented a cache friendly way to version our binaries [#962](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/962).

## What are the goals of next week

-   Implement Event sourced persistence [#913](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/913).
-   Remove deprecated internal commit [#954](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/954) and close [#728](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/728).

## Overview of sprint [95][sprint-95]

### Mithril

We've been working on integrating Mithril signature verification into
`dmq-node`. This involves implementing the necessary logic to handle and verify
signatures, ensuring that the node can correctly process Mithril-related data.
Progress is being tracked in [issue#5175] and [issue#5176].

### Cardano-Node

We worked on configuration and tracing improvements for the upcoming
`cardano-node` 10.6 release. The focus was on enhancing the user experience in
`Genesis` and `Praos` modes by refining how the network topology file is handled.
Specifically, we addressed issues where the topology file contains bootstrap
peers and genesis snapshot file locations, which are only relevant in one of the
modes. The goal is to ensure that parsing errors are minimised and that appropriate
log messages are emitted instead of errors in specific scenarios. Detailed
corner cases are documented in [issue#6304].

### Tx-Submission

We wrote a microbenchmark to evaluate the performance of the new tx-submission
decision logic.  The results will help identify any performance bottlenecks and
guide further optimisations. See [pr#5191].

### Chain-Sync Protocol Specification Update

The specification of the chain-sync mini-protocol has been relaxed to reflect
the `Cardano-Node` implementation more accurately.  The changes include
allowing the server to send `MsgRollBackward` after sending `MsgFindIntersect`
allowing the rollback to a point before the found intersection point.  See
[pr#5187].

### Disconnection Reason Propagation

After a discussion in the networking working group, we found out that we
could improve the debugging experience for SPOs by propagating the disconnection
reason from the low-level connection manager to the inbound / outbound governor.  This
will allow SPOs to understand better why a connection was dropped.  The work is
tracked in [pr#5189].

### QuickCheck-2.15 and 2.16

We relaxed the bounds of `QuickCheck` dependency for the upcoming
`cardano-node-10.6` release for a smoother transition, see [pr#5190].

### High-level Summary

This week, the Hydra team successfully fixed the fanout after contest bug using their significantly improved model-based test suite. Additionally, they transitioned to cardano-api version 8.38 and started testing against cardano-node version 8.8. Furthermore, they enhanced fee estimation within the hydra-node internal wallet resulting in cheaper head opening / closing transactions and added transaction metadata to help identifying Hydra protocol transactions.

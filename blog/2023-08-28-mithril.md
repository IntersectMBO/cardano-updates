## High level overview
The Mithril team created an explorer page with the registered signers to give recognition to the SPOs already running on mainnet. They also worked on refactoring and standardizing errors in the Mithril nodes, and they enhanced the clarity and reduced verbosity of the logs for the signer and aggregator nodes. Additionally, they started working on the implementation of `zstandard` compression of the snapshot archive, and streaming its download and decompression in the client.

Finally, they implemented machine readable progress information in the client, and streamlined the process of verifying the registration status of a signer.

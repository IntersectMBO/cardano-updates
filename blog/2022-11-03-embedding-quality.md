## High level summary

We made good progress on most of the Action Items we agreed on Lisbon, like:
* Cardano System Tests was fully open to public (tools, tests, results) 
  See [cardano-node-tests webpage](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node-tests).
* We defined an [user-facing-functionality template](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-facing-feature.md) that is used with the cardano-cli team 
  * this includes acceptance criteria & user stories, and definition of done
* We are in the process of running the cardano-node-tests at commit & PR level in cardano-node (we are affected by the Cicero migration right now but we did most of the work already)
* We started to apply a _labelling convention_ on [cardano-node issues](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues) that will be used to generate some visual dashboards with some metrics [TBD]
* Ziyand Liu started an _End-to-End Development and Testing Process for Plutus Features_

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team focused on supporting Cardano node v.10.4.1 and UTXO-HD in the aggregator, signer, and client.

They continued working on the DMQ node implementation, advancing the implementation of the local message submission and local message notification node-to-client mini-protocols in the Pallas library. They also worked on extending the aggregator metrics to record the usage of different client types.

Finally, they fixed a bug in the Cardano DB v2 snapshot that prevented full restoration and continued refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team focused on implementing new succinct proofs. The team worked on pre-aggregation SNARK primitives in the STM library, completed the bridging of CPU and circuit implementations, and worked on the lottery target pre-computation. They also kept adapting the certificate chain for SNARK-friendliness and implementing the authentication of signers SNARK verification keys.

Additionally, the team continued work on the new certification for Cardano blocks and transactions. This included implementing the prover, along with the proof routes in the aggregator REST API and the diffusion of signing configuration.

Finally, they kept working on static builds for Mithril nodes, fixed some bugs in the CI, and implemented support for the Cardano node v10.6.2.

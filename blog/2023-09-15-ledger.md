## High level summary

The Ledger team's focus is still mainly on the Conway era implementation.

We were able to add ability to specify initial Constitutional Comittee and the initial
version of Constitution. Priority in which Governance Action are now enacted matches the
specification. DRep's deposits are now properly accounted for. Governance actions that are
not allowed to be voted on by Stake Pool operators and Constitutional Committee members
are prevented by transaction submission failure, rather than simply being ignored. There
was a few important CDDL fixes as well as a lot of new round trip serialization
tests. Constraint based testing framework has also received a lot of improvements.

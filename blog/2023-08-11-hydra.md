## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team updated `hydra-node` to support `cardano-node` version
8.1.2, ensuring compatibility with the latest mainnet release. The team also
participated in discussions about a "cardanonical" JSON schema and added it as a
submodule to the project, contributing to improved data modeling and
interoperability.

In terms of community engagement, the team successfully onboarded a new
contributor, also participated in a RareEvo Twitter space, and continued
preparations for the Hydra master-class.

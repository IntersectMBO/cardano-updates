## High level summary

Ledger team continued working on conformance tests and other improvements to the ledger test suite. There was a lot of communication with community members and other core teams about the upcoming hard fork. Some of the Conway specific changes that could affect DApp developer where documented:

* [Deposit and refund amounts in stake credentials certificates are not visible to `PlutusV3`](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/issues/4571)
* [Effect of empty redeemers on the data integrity hash](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4554)
* [Effect of reference scripts on the transaction fee computation](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/blob/master/docs/adr/2024-08-14_009-refscripts-fee-change.md)

There was a minor bug discovered and fixed in how DRep expiration was initialized, which doesn't have any impact on the upcoming Chang hard fork, since DReps cannot affect ratification during the bootstrap phase.

## High level summary

This period Ledger team completed full definion in Haskell and binary representation with CDDL specification of what it means to be a Nested Transaction. Besides this important milestone we've tackled some tech dept, added ability to inject a Cost Model for any Plutus version upon startup for the purpose of testing and benchmarking, optimized memory accounts representation and improved usability of some predicate failures.
We made some very nice progress on enhancing CDDL specification with `cuddle`, which will allow us to reduce quite a bit of code duplication and improve CDDL conformance property testing.

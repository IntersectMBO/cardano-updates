## High level summary

As part of the tech dept reduction efforts we have restructured how stake is being computed, thus
also removing `Ptr` from stake distribution computation for Conway. Various minor serialization
fixes and failure reporting improvements.

We also added missing tests for block serialization roundtripping and CDDL conformance, which led to
us removing a bug in Babbage CDDL specification.

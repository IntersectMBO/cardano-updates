## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the new distribution [`2423.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2423.0), which includes the removal of the `snaphot` command of the client CLI, as well as bug fixes and optimizations. They also continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks and improved the throughput of the prover route of the aggregator by fixing some bottlenecks in the Merkle proof computation. Additionally, the team made progress on low-latency certification by working on the retrieval of the transactions with the chain sync mini-protocol and Pallas, as well as the handling of rollbacks of the chain.

Finally, they kept working on the threat modeling explainer for the documentation website and provided support for multiple TLS implementations in the client library thanks to a community contribution.

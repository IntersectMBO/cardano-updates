## High level overview
The Mithril team worked on deploying the era activation mechanism to their test networks and preparing the upgrade procedure to be implemented on the signer nodes run by the SPOs. They also refactored the state machines of the aggregator and signer nodes so that they can better handle critical errors, which lead to node panic, from recoverable errors. Additionally, the team continued the deployment of a new test network that runs on the Cardano `mainnet` and computes the stake distribution with the optimized unreleased Cardano CLI command.

Finally, they have designed the certification of generic types of data by a Mithril network and they have started implementing its first phase. Also they fixed a bug that made the client Docker image crash at startup.

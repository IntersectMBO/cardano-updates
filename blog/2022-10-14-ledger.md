## High level summary

The ledger team is still primarily focused on addressing
[technical](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%3Acredit_card%3A+technical-debt%22)
[debt](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/projects/3).
We now have the infrastructure for versioning our serialization schemes,
which we continue to put into action.
We have made first steps towards getting proper support for the
[formal ledger repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications)
(in particular, we've added nix builds and
continuous integration support).
We are wrapping up an investigation of the performance of a critical
function used by the consensus layer for leader checks.
Finally, we are improving the packaging and versioning of our code.

## Lower level summary

### Completed Technical Debt

- Because the Shelley ledger era was a complete re-write of the Byron ledger era, a lot of
  our code lives in the `cardano-ledger-shelley` package, though with hindsight we can say that
  much of it should live in `cardano-ledger-core`.
  We continue to move things to `cardano-ledger-core`, and have much more to come. [[pull-3059]]
- We now have the infrastructure to support **versioned** serialization schemes.
  The inability to do this has caused us a lot difficulties,
  such as [[issue-3003]], [[issue-2965]] and [[issue-2444]].
  We are still in the process of switching to the versioned serialization scheme
  (such as [[pull-3078]]),
  but the infrastructure was completed in [[pull-3063]].
- We now have proper nix and CI support for the formal ledger project. [[pull-19]]
- A separate team is helping bring support for
  [CHaP](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-haskell-packages)
  to all the cardano-node repositories.
  We have been helping out with this effort.
* A separate team continues working on upgrading all the
  cardano-node repositories to work with ghc 9.2.4.
  We have been helping out with this effort.

### In-progress Technical Debt

We also have several fairly large pull-requests in review
that we are working on.

- In an on-going attempt to build out a more user-friendly API,
  we continue to remove `HasField` instances in place of using micro-lenses.
  The protocol parameters, in particular, are being worked on. [[pull-3045]]
- We are also renaming record fields to be consistent across the repository. [[pull-3062]]
- We are now cleaning up all the work we did to understand the performance
  of the TICKF transition. We have some improvements to the computatation
  as well. [[pull-3068]]
- We are adding more documentation, in particular to our `Twiddler` functionality. [[pull-3073]]
- The formal ledger is adding support for finite set theory. [[pull-20]]

## Overview of [sprint 72][sprint-71]

### Security Policy

According to `IntersectMBO`s Open-Source Committee guidance, we updated our
[security policy].

### Tx-Submission

We have been working on the integration of the new `tx-submission` inbound side with `cardano-node`.

### New Typed-Protocols API

We published `typed-protocols-0.3.0.0` to `CHaP`.  It includes changes to
the `typed-protocols-stateful` API.  The added changes allow us to simplify
`LocalStateQuery` mini-protocol, particularly the `MsgResult` doesn't include
the request type (e.g. `query result`).  It is provided to the codec using the
associated local state mechanism instead.  See [typed-protocols#61], [chap#911].

The integration of `typed-protocols-0.3.0.0` with `ouroboros-network` was
merged to the `master` branch, see [ouroboros-network#4935].

The integration of this work stream with `cardano-node` is tracked on
[ouroboros-network#4936].

### `cardano-node-9.3`

We started working on `cardano-node-9.3` release.

### CI

* We improved the `check-stylish.sh` script: [ouroboros-network#4963].
* We refactored the `ouroboros-network.cabal` file: [ouroboros-network#4964].
* We refactored the nix configuration: [ouroboros-network#4968], which is continued in [ouroboros-network#4969].
* We wrote a patch to fix the nightly build: [ouroboros-network#4970].

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept implementing a new data type for certifying Cardano transactions within Mithril networks. They completed the upgrade of the client library and CLI to support the verification of Cardano transactions. They also released the new Mithril network running on SanchoNet. Additionally, they rolled out a new feature of the pallas chain observer that now supports the retrieval of Mithril era markers, and they kept investigating some flakiness occurring in the end-to-end tests in the CI.

Finally, the team kept working on the threat modeling and risk analysis for the Mithril network and updated the Mithril network architecture documentation.

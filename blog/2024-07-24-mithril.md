## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued preparing the upcoming release of the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks by fixing some bug preventing the import of transaction close to the tip of the chain, by investigating performance issues on imports of the mainnet and SanchoNet, by refactoring some types used for the block number and slot number, and by thoroughly benchmarking performances and testing edge case scenarios.

Finally, the team kept working on the certification of the Cardano stake distribution and continued redacting a CIP for the diffusion of Mithril signatures through the Cardano network.

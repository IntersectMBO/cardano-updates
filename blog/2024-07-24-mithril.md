## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team focused on preparing for the upcoming release of Cardano transaction certification in Mithril networks. They fixed a bug that was preventing the import of transactions close to the tip of the chain, investigated performance issues on imports from mainnet and SanchoNet, refactored some types used for block and slot numbers, and thoroughly benchmarked performance and tested edge cases.

Finally, the team continued working on the certification of the Cardano stake distribution and redacting a CIP for the diffusion of Mithril signatures through the Cardano network.

## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* A new cloud tagging resource effort is underway to better attribute and track
project expenses, implemented largely via infrastructure-as-code updates with
appropriate secrets handling.

* As part of the `10.6.0` pre-release candidate SRE to dev feedback loop, a
memory leak was identified in the pre-release candidate when LMDB ledger
backend was used. Further testing, deployment and debugging work helped
identify root cause and a fix was implemented.

* SRE team facilitated the passage of a [governance action](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/govAction/gov_action1zk80dvjfklp7cgvuvtg37zuwwe4r2erj6q3m67c7wdh0akth70rqq44samn)
on the preprod network, likely to be followed by a mainnet proposal and full community vote.

* Aarch64 cardano-node nix builds, binary release artifacts and OCI containers
will be added to the cardano-node repo in the near future.

* SRE team is providing support to the Midnight Scavenger Mine project which is
now live.

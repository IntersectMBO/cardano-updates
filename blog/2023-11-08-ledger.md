## High level summary

This update contains mostly improvements to quality of Conway era implementation and
tooling that we use for testing Ledger. Major Conway bugs that were discovered and
squashed are:

* PParamsUpdate proposals will now correctly use DRep thresholds for ratification
* Treasury withdrawals are now properly enacted.
* Corrected snapshotting and DRep Stake Distribution Pulser initialization
* Delegation to non-existent Stake pool is no longer possible

Other important quality of life improvements are addition of reusable interfaces for an
ordered set `OSet` and ordered map `OMap`. Which allowed us to disable duplicate
certificates and proposals in a transaction. As a precursor to `PlutusV3` integration, a
serious reorganization of Plutus related functionality was performed.

Conway related additions that are noteworthy: Conway Ledger events, disallowing voting on
expired proposals, addition of Anchor to Constitutional Committee resignation proposals.

Significant improvements have been made to a specialized "Imp" test library that allows us
writing concise stateful unit tests for verifying the Ledger logic. Serious progress has
been made on the conformance testing, where we can now interface with Haskell generated
code from the Agda specification. Serialization testing has been extended to increase
binary conformance coverage.

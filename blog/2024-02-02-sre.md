## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on cardano environment improvements and general
environment maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:
* Cardano explorer is being sunset and will soon be replaced by a new [Cardano
  Foundation explorer](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/)
* IOG mainnet pools are now participating in propagation time reporting using
  Cardano Foundation's [blockperf
  tool](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/blockperf)
* Cardano-parts node nixosConfigurations, node entrypoint and process-compose
  node jobs now utilize [mithril](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril)
  client automatically on preview and preprod networks for faster
  synchronization of first start up. Mainnet mithril client use as well as
  signer modules will be available soon.

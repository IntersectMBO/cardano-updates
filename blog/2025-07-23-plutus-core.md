## High level summary

### Plutus Core

- Following the support for case analysis on booleans and integers, we have now also merged the support for case analysis on lists.
  This allows UPLC programs to destruct lists using `case` expressions instead of built-in functions, which is more efficient.

- Supporting case analysis on bulit-in pairs and unit is in progress.

- We are working on enabling all built-in functions, as well as sums-of-products, in all Plutus ledger languages (Plutus V1, V2 and V3) at the upcoming intra-era hard fork.

- We are working on adding a new built-in type representing `Value`, along with built-in functions operating on `Value`s.

- We continue to work on adding the multi-scalar multiplization primitive.

### Plinth

- We added a utility to generate `.plutus` file from `CompiledCode`.
  This has the same behavior as Cardano API's `writeFileTextEnvelope`.
  It allows one to generate `.plutus` conveniently without depending on Cardano API.

- We added a new emitter mode `logWithCallTraceEmitter`, which uses trace messages generated by the `profile-all` flag of the Plinth compiler to create call trace of the functions that led to the evaluation failure.

- We added more realistic scripts in `plutus-benchmark` written in Plinth, including the open oracle protocol scripts and the cardano-loans scripts, providing improved coverage for evaluating the impact of language and compiler changes.

- We are working on compiling Haskell's `Bool` into UPLC's built-in boolean type, instead of Scott or sums-of-products encoded boolean.

### Formal Methods

- We added built-in arrays to the Plutus metatheory.

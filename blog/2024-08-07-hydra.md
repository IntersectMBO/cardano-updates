### High-level summary

We made good progress on some bugfixes; alongside moving the spec into a repo
where we can transition to more Agda. We made some minor improvements to our
tests, and spent a bit of time thinking about the details of the
implementation of incremental commits and the blockfrost chain layer idea. We
will continue on wrapping up the bugs, and preparing for Rare Evo with our new
landing page.

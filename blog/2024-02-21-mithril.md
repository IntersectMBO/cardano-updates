## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept implementing a new data type for certifying Cardano transactions within Mithril networks. They worked on enhancing the client CLI output and almost completed the support for the verification of Cardano transactions in the browser with the WASM client. The team also worked on a new feature of the Pallas chain observer to support stake distribution retrieval, and fixed the majority of the flakiness occurring in the CI end-to-end tests. Additionally, they have deployed the new Mithril network running on SanchoNet.

Finally, the team created a new example crate for using the client library to verify Cardano transactions, kept working on the threat modeling and risk analysis for the Mithril network, and completed their new tool for automatic documentation generation for the CLIs.

## High level summary

This period Ledger team has progressed with some work on Dijkstra era that is necessary for implementation of guards described in CIP-112. We've also finished up features necessary for the next intra-era hard fork. Besides that we did some general improvements, such restructure of how stake pools are represented in the state and test suite organization. We've also made a release of all ledger packages and prepared them for the upcoming cardano-node-10.6 release.

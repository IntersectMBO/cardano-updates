## High level summary

Unfortunately, due to the ZuriHac conference, we ended up skipping the Ledger update for the last
period, therefore this update contains our accomplishments over the period of four weeks.

Extensive investigation into current CDDL specification and efforts of improving our testing tools
lead to discovery and fixes of numerous bugs in CDDL specification dating back all the way to the
Byron era. We have also improved readability of Ledger CDDL specification through enhancements to
our CDDL generation tool. We have further tackled a whole bunch of tech debt and introduced
performance improvements. Thanks to dropping support for ghc-8.10 we were able to add some safety
improvements as well, that utilize features of the newer compiler.

Besides improvements to the existing code we have started preparation for an upcoming intra-era hard
fork, which is planned to happen some time later this year and the new Dijkstra era that will happen
no earlier than next year. We have fixed one more bug in preparation for the intra-era hardfork and
started preliminary work for Nested Transactions.

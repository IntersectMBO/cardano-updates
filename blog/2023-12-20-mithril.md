## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team completed aggregator optimizations, enabling the certification of new data types without introducing a new era. They also facilitated the selection of these data types through a simple configuration parameter.  Additionally, the team started implementing a mock aggregator to strengthen Mithril client tests in WASM, kept working on threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking, and progressed with the implementation of a testing Mithril network for SanchoNet.

Finally, they worked on some optimizations and refactoring of the Mithril client CLI, and they started upgrading the Cardano node topology used in the Mithril networks infrastructure.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team completed optimizations on the aggregator to handle new types of data to be certified without the need to introduce a new era, and to allow the selection of these types of data with a simple configuration parameter. They have also started implementing a mock aggregator that will help strenghen the tests of the Mithril client in WASM. Additionally, the team kept working on the threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking, along with progressing in the implementation of a testing Mithril network for SanchoNet.

Finally, they worked on some optimizations and refactoring of the Mithril client CLI, and they started upgrading the Cardano node topology used in the Mithril networks infrastructure.

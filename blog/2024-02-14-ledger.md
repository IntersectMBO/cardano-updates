## High level summary

Last few weeks were spent mostly on implementing various fixes, writing tests and
improving capabilities of our testing frameworks. Important bug fixes are:

* Retention of Anchor for proposal procedures in the ledger state in order for users to be
  able to query the node for those anchors
* JSON serialization of rational numbers in protocol parameters and governance procedures
  are encoded without loss of precision

Feature wise, we've added a new protocol parameter that controls the contribution of
reference scripts sizes in the transaction fee calculation formula.

Major achievement that is worth announcing is a Haskell package named
[`cuddle`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cuddle) that we developed over the last few
months. Soon we will be transitioning to specifying CDDL in Haskell for all eras using
that package. It will be used to compile the CDDL specification that developers in the
community rely on so much. There are enormous benefits in using this tool, when compared
to writing CDDL specification manually. Namely it allows us to reduce duplication and
reuse common and unchanged specification from previous eras. It also improves safety and
correctness of our specification and decoders, because it ensures that the specification
is well typed and it uses QuickCheck to generate random data for validating that our
decoders are implemented according to the spec.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team completed the adaptation of the Mithril client library for WASM compilation, providing a JavaScript API for it. They also completed the proof of concept to demonstrate that a subset of Cardano transactions is part of the entire transactions set. The refactoring of the Mithril client CLI with the Mithril client library was also finalized. Additionally, the team kept working on the threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking, along with progressing in the implementation of a testing Mithril network for SanchoNet.

Finally, they started implementing an expiration mechanism for the open messages in the aggregator, and they completed the upgrade of Rust dependencies with breaking changes.

## High level summary

Major milestone was reached this period. We've implemented
[CIP-0069](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0069) that improves
`PlutusV3` functionality by making spending datums optional and enforcing all scripts to
have exactly one argument. This feature allows for spending scripts to be usable for other
purposes, like minting for example.

Couple of important bugs have been fixed:

* Script execution for certificates with the same plutus script did not execute correctly.
* Prevent delegation to a non-existent pool.

With this feature complete and a few bug fixes we were also able to mark Conway era and
[CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694) as feature
complete and ready for release. Naturally, testing of Conway era will continue all the way
into the hard fork.

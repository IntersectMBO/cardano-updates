## High-level overview of [sprint 48][sprint-48]

### Bootstrap Peers

We continued reviewing bootstrap peers, [ouroboros-network#4555].

### IOClasses / IOSim

We prepared slides for a Haskell meetup were we presented a talk on `IOSimPOR`.
The recording will be availble on `YouTube`.

We also used the opportunity to do some refactoring of the `IOSim` code base: [io-sim#117].
We released `io-sim-1.3.0.0` on `Hackage`: [io-sim#119].

We also added `forkFinally` to `MonadFork` (not included in `1.3.0.0` release): [io-sim#123].

### Tech debt

We refactored `Resource` used by the DNS subsystem: [ouroboros-network#4707].
We continued reviewing the [ouroboros-network#4625] PR, which refactors
`RootPeersDNS` module.

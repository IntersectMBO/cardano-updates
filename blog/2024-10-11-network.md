## Overview of [sprint 72][sprint-72]

[sprint-72]: https://github.com/orgs/IntersectMBO/projects/5/views/1?filterQuery=sprint%3A%22Sprint+72%22

### `cardano-node` release: `10.0`

We have been working on the `cardano-node-10.0` release.

* [Removed versions older than NodeToNodeV_12][ouroboros-network#4985]
* [Introduced NodeToNodeV_14][ouroboros-network#4986]

### Tx-Submission

We have been running an experimental build of `cardano-node` with new
`tx-sumbission` logic [ouroboros-network#3311].  Some performance bottlenecks have been found by Karl
Knutsson ([CF]), but not deadlocks or race conditions.
* [Send TraceTxSubmissionProcessed for the new TX submission][ouroboros-network#4978]
* [Let the thread which fetched a TX add it to the mempool][ouroboros-network#4984]

### Preparations for removal of Non-P2P network code

In order to prepare for removal of the network stack we addressed two issues:

* expose `Mux` API for `node-to-client`s, so that they have more control over
  how mini-protocols are running (e.g. implement ones own mini-protocol restart
  policy) [ouroboros-network#3231], [ouroboros-network#4979]
* reimplement `cardano-client` without using non-p2p network code (e.g. the
  [subscribtion worker]), [ouroboros-network#4979]

On the way we also addressed a few technical debt items:
* removed `Network.Mux.Compat` interface: [ouroboros-network#4974]
* [Clean-up Network.Mux.Channel][ouroboros-network#4336]
* [Add bearer name][ouroboros-network#3472]

### Documentation

We updated the documentation of the peer-sharing mini-protocol:
[ouroboros-network#4981], [ouroboros-network#4983].

We updated the `SECURITY.md` file according to the IntersectMBO's
Open-Source Committee guidance, [ouroboros-network#4986].

### io-sim

* [Distinct TVarIds for various TVar roles][io-sim#177]
* Reviewed PRs contributed by Javier Sagredo ([IOG], Consensus Team):
  * [Implement MonadLabelledMVar][io-sim#176]
  * [Improve show of ScheduleMod][io-sim#175]
  * [Attach label to TVars mentioned in Effects][io-sim#174]
  * [Make takeMVar exception safe][io-sim#182]

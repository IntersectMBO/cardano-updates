## High level summary

One very important Conway feature that became available since last report is the ability
for Stake Pool Operators to vote on some of the security relevant protocol parameter
updates. We organized proposal hierarchy into a cohesive implementation, which together
with good tests gives us confidence in its correctness.

We also fixed a few important bugs:

* Preventing Constitutional Committee Members from voting on governance actions that they
  should not be allowed to vote on.
* Prevent deposits from appearing in orphaned reward accounts after the staking credential
  has been unregistered, but before the proposal procedure deposit has been returned.
* Ensure Sets are encoded in CBOR with tag 258 by default

Further improvements in testing tools and addition of more tests.

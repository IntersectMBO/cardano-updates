## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued their work on the certification of Cardano stake distribution. They completed the implementation of new routes for the aggregator REST API and worked on the verification steps in the client library. The draft CIP for the diffusion of Mithril signatures through the Cardano network is nearly complete. Additionally, they finished benchmarking the signer's footprint for Cardano transactions on the SPO infrastructure.

The team also fixed a bug in the transaction importer that prevented some transactions from being imported near the chain tip and resolved an issue on the documentation website

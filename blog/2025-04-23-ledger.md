## High level summary

Our focus was on fixing technical debt that would affect the definition of a new era, as well as improvements to the CI and tests.
We added a check in the `MEMPOOL` rule that detects duplicate transactions and shortcircuits the rule if encountered.

The team also completed integration work for the node release 10.3.0.

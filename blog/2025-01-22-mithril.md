## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database. They completed the cloud synchronization of artifacts, introduced enhancements and optimizations for artifact production, and adapted the explorer to accommodate these changes. Additionally, they finalized the design for splitting the mithril-common crate and re-spun the testing-sanchonet network.

Other progress includes starting work on compressing aggregator HTTP responses, fixing a bug that prevented debug logs from being produced on the nodes, and resolving an issue with Prometheus data recording in the infrastructure.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database: they completed the cloud synchronization of the artifacts, worked on some enhancements and optimizations for the production of the artifacts, and worked on the adaptation of the explorer. They completed the design of the split of the mithril-common crate. The team also re-spun the testing-sanchonet network.

Finally, they started to work on the compression of the aggregator HTTP responses, they fixed a bug that prevented the production of the debug logs on the nodes, and they fixed a problem with the recording of some Prometheus data in the infrastructure.

## High level summary

- Work is ongoing on improving the Genesis tests. In particular, a centralized chain-sync-jumping model was developed to help troubleshoot test failures, which proved difficult to do using the decentralized model.
- The Consensus team had its representative in the Node Diversity workshop. The report can be found in [this link](https://forum.cardano.org/t/node-diversity-workshop-april-2025/145248).
- Collaborated with the Ouroboros Phalanx/Anti-Grinding Innovation Team, as an initial step in providing engineer input on the design.

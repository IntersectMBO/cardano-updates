# Ledger Update

We have continued focusing nearly entirely on addressing technical debt.
A lot of design work has begun for the next ledger era,
but we do not yet have anything concrete to share.

## Technical debt issues completed

* [[issue-1676]][[pull-2992]] We have finally removed the ledger dependency on the
  `cardano-prelude` package. It was barely used in the ledger repository, and it added a dependency
  that we did not want to maintain. It was a bit difficult to remove, and we had
  to coordinate removing it from cardano-base.
  A lot ended up going into [pull-2992][pull-2992], due to the coordination effort, and we ended
  up updating Plutus as well.
  This means that we've now also made a lot of progress on the problematic cost model serialization
  issues described in [issue-2902].
  In particular, after we resolve [issue-3014], we will not have to wait an epoch before
  releasing a cost model for a new version of Plutus, as we had to do for the Vasil HF. 
* [[issue-3046]][[pull-3055]] We moved a module that is now only used in Byron to a Byron package.
* [[issue-3047]][[pull-3054]] We improved the interface to the `Value` (multi-asset) type.
* [[pull-3044]] We debugged and fixed a tricky compilation issue. Certain kinds of field updates
  were adding approximately 20 minutes to our compile time!
* [[issue-2932]][[pull-3036]] As a part of our ongoing re-organization of the codebase, we
  have added a `Cardano.Ledger.[Era].Core` module to each ledger era that has a TxBody class.
  Most classes defined in the era should go in this new module.
  We also re-export the `Cardno.Ledger.Core` module and the previous `Cardano.Ledger.[Era].Core`
  modules from each era.
  
## Technical debt in progress

* [[issue-3034]][[issue-3035]][[node-issue-4421]] We are continuing to write benchmarks to understand exactly where
  all the time is being spent on executing the `TICKF` transition.
  The consolidation of the per-stake-credential stake distribution to the per-stake-pool
  distribution does seem to account for a large amount of time (near a second as written, which we
  have down to about half a second with some optimizations),
  but this does not account for everything.
  Applying the reward update may also be a big contributing factor.
* [[pull-3033]][[pull-3038]][[pull-3041]] A separate team is working on upgrading all the
  cardano-node repositories to work with ghc 9.2.4. We have been helping out with this effort.
* The nix scripts used to build our new
  [formal ledger model](https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications)
  do not work consistently for everyone, and we have been working on fixing these issues.
* [[issue-3014]] We are still working on adding a versioning scheme to all of the ledger
  serializers.

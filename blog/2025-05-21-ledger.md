## High level summary

Last period we were finally able to drop support for older GHC versions. We also made some cleanup
that was necessary as preparation work for further refactoring that is underway, which is necessary
for both Leios and Nested Transactions. Refactoring definitions of protocol parameters is quite an
accomplishment, since it drastically reduces complexity and eliminates unnecessary duplication for
all eras. This refactoring not only reduced amount of code around protocol parameters for previous
eras, but will also drastically simplify the process of adding new protocol parameters in the future
eras.

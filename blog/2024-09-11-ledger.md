## High level summary

One specific Conway feature that received a lot of debate has finally been implemented,
namely disallowing stake credentials from withdrawing rewards, that are backed by a key
hash and have not delegated to any DRep.  This feature will go into effect after the
bootstrap phase.

A whole lot more tests were added and few minor bug fixes have been implemented as well.
In particular `GovInfoEvent` ledger event has been fixed, which is unlikely to affect
anyone, but it is worth pointing out.  Ledger state deserialization bug was fixed that was
necessary for the `cardano-node-9.1.1` release.  Some tech dept was taken care of, like
cleanup of unnecessary predicate failures and fixing some flaky tests from Byron and
Alonzo eras.

### High-level Summary

This week, the team made finally progress on the model based testing framework (and reproducing a bug) by fixing issues related to fully validating Cardano transactions. They also enabled continuous deployment of `hydra-explorer` to <http://explorer.hydra.family/heads>, facilitating easier access for users. Furthermore, they improved code quality by incorporating Haskell linting into their CI workflow and addeda user-ished conversion of `HeadId` to `CurrencySymbol`.

### What did the team achieve this week

- Fixed model based testing framework to fully validate Cardano transactions
- Enabled continuous deployment of `hydra-explorer` to <http://explorer.hydra.family/heads>
- Identified need for cardano-node 8.8 and cardano-api 8.38 (breaking changes) to continue integration with Conway networks
- Added Haskell linting to our CI workflow - Minor addition to convert `HeadId` into `CurrencySymbol` [\#919](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/919)
- Reviewed a small refactor PR on our model-based test runner [\#1300](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1300)

### What are the goals of next week

- Fix the fanout after contest bug
- Bite the bullet and have a non-mainnet compatible `master` to complete smoke tests on `sanchonet`
- Specify the on-chain validators for incremental decommits

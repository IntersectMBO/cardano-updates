## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team updated the CIP of the DMQ protocol and its implementations in Pallas and Mithril nodes to impact modifications in the structure of the message and the n2c local notification mini-protocol. They worked on preparing the pre-release of the next distribution. They also continued collaborating with the innovation team on prototyping a SNARK proving circuit for Mithril certificates. Additionally, the team kept prototyping a Mithril/Cardano bundle in a Docker image

Finally, they enhanced the CI workflows used to verify the integrity of a restored Cardano database and made progress refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

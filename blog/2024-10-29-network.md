## Overview of [sprint 73][sprint-73]

### Ouroboros-Network-0.18 release

We released `ouroboros-network-0.18`.  The main features are:

* integration with `typed-protocols-0.3`
* `cardano-client` library doesn't depend on the non-p2p stack
* We expose `connectToWithMux` family of function in `ouroboros-network` which
  give access to the underlying [`Mux` handle][mux-handle].
* Added `NodeToClientV_19`: to support new `GetLedgerPeerSnapshot` query in
  `local-state-query` mini-protocol [ouroboros-consensus#1067].

See full [the list of PRs][ouroboros-network-0.18] included in this release.
`ouroboros-network-0.18` was integrated with `ouroboros-consensus` ([ouroboros-consensus#1223])

### Tx-Submission

We continued working on `tx-submission` monitoring its performance.

### Ouroboros-Network - Mithril Design

We had an internal discussion how to support the [Mithril design][cip#137].  In
near future we will be able to socialise the report we've been working on.

### Code Refactoring

We reorganised some of our substysems to use qualified imports with simplified names:
* [ouroboros-network#4990] (`connection-manager`, `inbound-governor`)
* [ouroboros-network#4997] (`network-mux`)

We also removed deprecated APIs in [ouroboros-network#4998]

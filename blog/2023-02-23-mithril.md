## High level overview
The Mithril team released a new [`2306.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2306.0) distribution that implements minor fixes and updates and completes the wiring of the era activation markers reader into the signer and aggregator nodes. They also designed an event store in the aggregator and completed its implementation as a monitoring solution to provide figures for deployment rates of versions on signer nodes before activating an era switch. Additionally, the team created a dedicated command on their nodes’ CLI that allows generating and signing an era marker’s payload to be stored on the Cardano chain, as well as creating dynamic cases for the end-to-end tests they run on the CI.

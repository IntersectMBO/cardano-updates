## High level overview
The Mithril team launched **Mithril protocol’s mainnet beta**: the `release-mainnet` network is now open for signer registrations, and its genesis certificate has been created. The team is monitoring the network, and expects it to start producing certificates during the next Cardano epoch. 

They have released a new distribution [`2329.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2329.0), which is running on the `release-mainnet` network. They also kept working on the implementation of the stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator. The team kept working on the refactoring of the serialization/deserialization of the entities of the cryptographic library. Additionally, they completed the cleanup of the legacy store adapters in the aggregator.

Finally, they have worked on enhancing the documentation for [onboarding SPOs](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/SPO-on-boarding-guide) and setting up a [Mithril signer](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/run-signer-node), and fixing installation bugs of the binary artifacts produced in the CI.

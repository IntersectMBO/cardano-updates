### High-level summary

The team has been working hard on a collection of fixes and user-requested
features, while also continuing to support the Midnight Glacier Drop. Perhaps
most interestingly we have added the ability to bring in partial amount [when
performing a
commit](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/blob/master/docs/docs/how-to/incremental-commit.md#deposit-utxo-to-commit).
We continue to work on important improvements and user requests, we will start
to investigate the partial fanout feature we've wanted to work on for a while,
and continue to support the Glacier Drop!

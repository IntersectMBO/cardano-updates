## High level summary

This period we have discovered and fixed a bug in ledger that was also backported in a patch release of `cardano-node-10.1.3`. The bug manifests itself in the protocol version 10 and affects DRep delegations. It does not affect mainnet in a meaningful way, because DReps cannot yet vote on any proposal that affects the ledger state or the chain. However, in order to have the correct behavior in the protocol version 10 we do need to use this patched version.

Besides this bugfix we continued working on testing and taking care of some tech dept. We also added a new ledger state query that allows asking the node for current DRep voting stake distribution.

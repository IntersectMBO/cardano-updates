## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the `2537.0` distribution which provides support for Cardano node v.10.5.1, stabilizes commands of the client CLI, provides support for ARM pre-built binaries, and includes various bug fixes and improvements.

They completed the update of the CIP of the DMQ protocol and its implementation in Pallas and Mithril nodes, introducing changes to the message structure and the n2c local notification mini-protocol. They kept working on the preparatory phase of decentralizing configuration parameters and on the support for multiple proof systems in the STM library

Finally, a part of the team attended the Node Diversity Workshop #2 event in Toulouse, France, and they started to test the integration of the Haskell DMQ node with the Mithril nodes.

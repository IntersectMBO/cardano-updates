## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued focusing on the implementation of the SNARK-friendly STM library. They also made progress on assessing constraints on Halo2 verification keys, designing a testing strategy for SNARK circuits, crafting SNARK-friendly protocol parameters, and prototyping the recursive SNARK solution.

Additionally, they kept testing the DMQ node and preparing its deployment, and enhanced the signer and signature registration metrics and logs.

Finally, they worked on improvements to the protocol security page, and kept upgrading the Cardano node to v.10.6.

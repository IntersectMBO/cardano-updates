## High level summary

This period Ledger team has implemented an improvement to withdrawals predicate failure reporting, that will become available with next intra-era hardfork. We've also experimented with a potential representation in Haskell for transaction levels relateed to CIP-118: sub-transactions vs top level transactions. Besides that we did some more code cleanup and made further improvements to the test suite.

Aside from development work there was Ledger team presence at the Node Diversity workshop, which included relevant people from all of the alternative Node implementations that are currently under development.

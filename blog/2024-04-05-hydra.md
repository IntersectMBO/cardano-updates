### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team released hydra 0.16.0, which supports cardano-node 8.9.0
and can interpret conway blocks on the cardano-node. We have also updated some hydra
clients to be compatible with the new hydra api format, including hydraw and kupo.

### What did the team achieve this week
- Update our head and `hydraw` instance to `master` (a release candidate)
- Release 0.16.0 (without incremental decommits)
- Reproduce close > contest > contest scenarios using stateful testing
- Have end-to-end scenarios working for the improved `/commit` endpoint

### What are the goals of next week
- Complete the improved `/commit` endpoint to unblock users
- Potentially release 0.17.0 (with improved `/commit` endpoint)
- Wrap up the incremental decommit work including the decommit action into the new TxTrace tests
- Use Versioned Ouroboros protocol for handshaking between nodes.
- Update to cardano-api-8.44.

We focused on our new release:
[0.22.0](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/releases/tag/0.22.0), and
made some quality of life improvements. We spent a good amount of time
investigating a tricky issue related to
[deadlocks](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/2089), and will
[continue our

also focus on making [a patch release
0.22.1](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/2088) to fix the issues
identified.

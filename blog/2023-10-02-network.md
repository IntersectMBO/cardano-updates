## High-level overview of [sprint 45][sprint-45]

[sprint-45]: https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/19/views/16?filterQuery=sprint%3A%22sprint+45%22

### Bootstrap Peers

We started reviewing the bootstrap peers PR, [ouroboros-network#4615].

### Towards Typed Protocols 0.2.0.0

We discovered a performance regression when using `typed-protocols-0.2.0.0`, and we
started investigating where it comes from.  Currently, we see that
`typed-protocols-0.2.0.0` can outperform `typed-protocols-0.1.0.0` when running
in isolation with a simple `ping-pong` protocol, so the regression might be in
the new block fetch implementation which comes with `typed-protocols-0.2.0.0`
See [typed-protocols#3].

### Tech Debt

We merged two PRs written by Galois engineers:

* a pull request which refactors the main entry function for P2P, see [ouroboros-network#3834]; 
* a pull request which reviews usage of `unsafe` function in the network code based.

Galois also made progress with the following two issues:
 * add microbenchmarks to some of our tests: [ouroboros-network#3832]
 * inspect use of `error` in `ouroboros-network` repository:
   [ouroboros-network#3836]

### IO-Sim

#### IOSimPOR
We found and fixed a bug in `IOSimPOR`.  We'd like to thank Prof. John Hughes
(Quviq AB) for helping us with debugging the issue.

We also provided a more uniform API for `IOSimPOR`, and added ways to make the
debugging similar problems in the future easier.

<details>
<summary>Technical Details on IOSim refactoring</summary>
We removed the usage of `unsafePerformIO` from `IOSimPOR`, which also means
removing parallel evaluation of discovered races.  We found out that it gives
only 25% better performance.  In the future QuickCheck will offer running
different cases in parallel which should provide better performance as there
are no dependencies between the evaluation of different test cases, while schedules
are discovered while running which limits the possible gains from running them
concurrently.  The performance was not the only factor though.  When using
parallelism in the lazy `ST` monad we'd need to rely on memory guarantees of
`STRefs`.  In `GHC-9.6` they share the implementation with `IORef`s, but it
might not be the case in the future.

#### IOSim

To prepare for the next release, we consolidate packages taking advantage of
the public sublibraries supported now both by `cabal` and `Hackage`.   This is
a work in progress, [io-sim#114].

### Cardano Newtork Service Assurance

Galois made the following progress:

* A test run of spinning up a CNSA instance was done, as a result documentation
  was updated.
* Based on the IOG code review of the CNSA code, updates to the CNSA code were
  made.
* Galois has started the design for adding a CNSA analysis for "fetched bytes
  over time while node is syncing".

### P2P adoption

In the last two weeks, we've seen increase in P2P adoption.

The following graphs show several different versions of relays running on the mainnet.  The
green line `NodeToNodeVersionV10.True` denotes P2P relays.

### Open Source

We upstreamed our FFI bindings to Windows named pipes to `Win32` package, the
PR was accepted and merged.

We also received an external contribution which enhanced our documentation, see
[ouroboros-network#4676].

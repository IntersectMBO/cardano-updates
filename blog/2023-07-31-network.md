## Network Update (Sprints 39 & 40)

The network updates got distracted.  Mostly because of me leaving for the meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland and the being away.
It was great to see and talk to so many of the community members.

### Sprint 39 (Jun 26 - Jul 09)

#### Major changes

Now the following __list of traces will be turned on by default__:

##### `node-to-client` protocol

- `LocalConnectionManagerTracer` 
- `LocalInboundGovernor`
- `LocalHandshake`
- `LocalServer`

##### `node-to-node` protocol

- `Server`

See [cardano-node#5353].  This will be released in `node-8.2.0`.


We made sure that `cardano-client-0.1.0.x` library (which is `db-sync`) is not using the experimental `node-to-client` protocol.
The `cardano-client-0.2.0.0` was not affected.
See [ouroboros-network#4612].

We merged the __dynamic block production feature__ to `ouroboros-consensus` (also available in the `cardano-node-8.2.0` release).
Dynamic block production enables hot-swap p2p nodes, which are important for the p2p deployment of block-producing nodes.
See [ouroboros-network#3159], [ouroboros-consensu#140].

We continued to review the implementation of big ledger peers for eclipse evasion, see [ouroboros-network#4462].

#### Minor changes

- We refactored the top level `cardano-node` error handler: [cardano-node#5356]


### Sprint 40 (Jul 09 - Jul 23)

#### Major changes

We integrated `ouroboros-network-0.8.2.0` with the `master` branch of `cardano-node` for the `8.2.0` release (the version match between `ouroboros-network` and `cardano-node` is purely accidental).
This includes:

* integration with __dynamic block production__ feature.
  This feature is documented in the [following PR][cardano-node#5399].
* __Warm valency__ for local root peers (see below).

For the full list of features included in the `8.2.0` release from the network side, please take a look at the [pre-release nodes][cardano-node-8.2.0-pre].


We __improved the memory footprint__ of peer metrics measured by the P2P stack.
Peer metrics are used to decide which peers to demote every churn interval (roughly every hour with some probabilistic fluctuation).
See [ouroboros-network#4620].
The improvement will be available in `cardano-node-8.2.0`.

We added an __optional explicit warm valency__ to local root peers of the __P2P topology file__.
Previously we used an implicit valency, e.g. the node keeps connections to all of the local roots; with local warm valency the node will pick only that many peers from the local root peers group to connect to.
The hot valency (previously known simply as valency) hasn't changed, but it must be smaller than the warm valency as hot peers are selected from warm ones.
Warm valency is a useful feature to limit resource consumption if one of the domain names in the local root peer group resolves to many IP addresses.
See [ouroboros-network#4575], [cardano-node#5409].

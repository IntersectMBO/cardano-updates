# Network Update

## Ouroboros Network

* We finished high and low level _peer sharing_ design. See
  [Peer Sharing Implementation Plan](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/wiki/Peer-Sharing-Implementation-Plan)
* We started working on low-level design of _eclipse evasion_ (work in
  progress).
* We decided to use **peer sharing** instead of overloaded and ambiguous _gossip_ term.
  [PR input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3980](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3980)
* We fixed technical dept
  [issue input-output-hk/cardano-node#3905](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3905) in
  the simulation testing of diffusion
  [PR input-output-hk/cardano-node#4004](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4004)
* We deployed all our nodes using our new nix based deployment architecture.
  When deploying we found an issue in the
  [`RTView`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/3752).

## Ouroboros Consensus

* Recently we found out that the consensus does not log exceptions thrown during
  intiialisation.  This was fixed in
  [PR input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#4015](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4015)
  As part of this pull request we also changed that all exceptions rethrown by
  the connection handler thread are wrapped in `ExceptionInHandler`.

### Some older items, which were not announced

* We identified and fixed an issue related to socket activation (socket options
  where not set for sockets passed through socket activation).
  [PR input-output-hk/cardano-node#3979](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3979)
  This fix will be released in the next `cardano-node` release.

## Cardano Node

* We extended the NixOs service module so that one can modify `socketPath`,
  `runtimeDir`, `databasePath`, `traceSocketPathAccept`,
  `traceSocketPathConnect` and `stateDir` options.
   [PR input-output-hk/cardano-node#4196](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/4196)

## IO-Sim

We resolved a number of issues before release of `io-sim` on hackage:

* [issue input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#2797](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2797)
* [issue input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#2650](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2650)
* [issue input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3436](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3436)
* [issue input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#2588](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2588)
* [issue input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#2587](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2587)
* [issue input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#2586](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2586)

See [PR #24](https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/24).

We also improved experience for contributors of `io-sim` and `typed-protocols` by adding issue templates:
* [PR input-output-hk/io-sim#25](https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/25)

## Typed Protocols

* We pushed a branch which identifies a GHC quirk:
  [coot/typed-protocols-rewrite-StateToken-problem](https://github.com/input-output-hk/typed-protocols/tree/coot/typed-protocols-rewrite-StateToken-problem).
  That's too be resolved in order to push forward review of the redesign in
  [PR input-output-hk/typed-protocols#3](https://github.com/input-output-hk/typed-protocols/pull/3).
* As for `io-sim`, we wrote issue templates:
  [PR input-output-hk/typed-protocols#11](https://github.com/input-output-hk/typed-protocols/pull/11)

## Input Endorsers Simulation

New features include:

* Histograms of block arrival frequency, for both network (inbound) and CPU
  (block validation). This is interesting to check that we're not overloading
  the CPU block validation capacity, or network link capacity. Or alternatively
  to observe the behaviour in an overload situation if we set the block
  generation rate high enough.

* Pie chart of utilisation of TCP links. This shows how small a fraction of
  links are being used at any one time, and shows that once the system "warms
  up" and is operating stably, most block delivery is ballistic.

* Showing off the new screen layout combinators, that let us put multiple
  charts, titles etc on screen at once and scale them to whatever screen or
  video resolution we like without having to tweak numbers (this example is
  scaled to fit 1080HD video resolution).

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept working on decentralizing the Mithril networks with the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking proof of concept. They progressed with the adaptation of the Mithril client as a library, and worked on its full WASM compatibility in a proof of concept. The team kept working on the deterministic computation of the transactions from the immutable files, and fixed some unreachability issue on the `release-mainnet` aggregator.

Finally, they implemented new Docker images that build the Mithril nodes on the 'devnet' faster and fixed some regressions in the Mithril client CLI.

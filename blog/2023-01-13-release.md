## Node Reelease Update
## 2022-11-02 - 2023-01-13

### Executive Summary

A 1.35.5 release for single relay P2P is nearly completed and should be released this month. This release is based on
`release/1.35` branch and does not bump cardano-ledger.

The team successfully integrated an interim release bump of ledger and consensus into cardano-node master.
This work will not be released in a node version, but will be continued by the current dependency bump in progress.

We anticipate once this dependency bump is completed, regular 2 week releases will be feasible again.

The 1.35.4 release is being ran by more than 70% of stake pools. Planning for the mainnet hard fork date is in progress.

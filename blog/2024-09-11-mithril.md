## High level overview

The Mithril team continued working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. In this preliminary phase, they kept implementing a buffer store for individual signatures that may arrive before being processed by an aggregator. They also worked on refactoring the state machine of the signer and addressed panics occurring in both the signer and aggregator during rollbacks of Cardano transactions. Additionally, they modified the pre-loading mechanism for importing Cardano transactions, ensuring it repeats indefinitely in the signer.

Finally, the team kept preparing the next distribution and they investigated some breaking change introduced in a dependency of the Hydra CI.

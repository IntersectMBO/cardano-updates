## High level summary

As part of tackling tech dept we have worked on improving the entrypoint interface that consensus
uses to interact with ledger. Besides that we worked on restructuring some parts of the ledger state
representation to make a more type safe distinction for changes introduced in Conway era. We have
also implemented an alternative way of deserializing types that live on chain, which once intergrated
into downstream components will allow us to have faster and more accurate decoders.

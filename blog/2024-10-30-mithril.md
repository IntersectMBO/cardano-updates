## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the new [CIP-137 - Decentralized message queue](https://discord.com/channels/826816523368005654/1014019542504185876/1301043609092751410), which will be used to diffuse Mithril signatures in the future.

The team also implemented usage metrics with a Prometheus endpoint and published the Grafana dashboard for the aggregator. They have respun the `testing-sanchonet` environment with Cardano node v.10.1 and worked on some refactoring to remove legacy code and make it more readable and maintainable. The team also started exploring solutions for signer registration when multiple aggregators are running on a Mithril network.

Finally, they fixed some flakiness in CI end-to-end tests and made the Cardano stake distribution stable in the client.

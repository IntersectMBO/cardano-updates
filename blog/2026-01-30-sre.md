## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* A cardano-node `10.5.4` release and `10.6.2` pre-release version are quite
close.  SRE has been iterating on candidate deployments for these versions to
our infrastructure and offering feedback to relevant development teams where
appropriate.


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Cardano-airgap
[cardano-airgap PR#12](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-airgap/pull/12):
* Bumps disko to `v1.13.0`
* Fixes running disko scripts in the iso environment after bumping nixpkgs by
  adding required deps via closure path reference to `/etc/install-closure`.
* Adds binary iso-versioning, available from devShell and in the iso
  environment which provides relevant component version info in centered GitHub
  md table format.


### Cardano-faucet
[cardano-faucet PR#17](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-faucet/pull/17):
* Updates the flake inputs and haskell dependencies of cardano-faucet.
  Specifically, upgrade cardano-api to `10.19` for cardano-node `10.6.x`
  compatibility, and fix the resulting compiler errors.  This prepares the faucet
  for functioning through the upcoming intra-era hard fork.


### Iohk-nix
[cardano-node-release/10.5.4 branch](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/tree/cardano-node-release/10.5.4):
* Provides a preview environment checkpoint file as well as per-environment
  peer snapshot file and "use ledger peers after" slot updates for cardano-node
  release `10.5.4`.

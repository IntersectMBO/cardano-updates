## High level overview

The Mithril team has released a new distribution [`2342.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2342.0), which includes the following enhancements: support for SPO tickers displayed in the Mithril explorer, and support for producing slim Docker images for the Mithril nodes.

They also kept working on the decentralization of the Mithril networks with a proof of concept of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking between nodes. The team kept working on the adaptation of the Mithril client as a library, and on the deterministic computation of the UTxO set from the immutable files. Additionally, they fixed the bottleneck of the key registration in the aggregator.

Finally, they investigated some unreachability on the `release-mainnet` aggregator, and they enhanced the UI of the Mithril explorer.

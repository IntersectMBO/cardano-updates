## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released a new distribution [`2342.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2342.0). This release includes support for SPO tickers displayed in the Mithril explorer and the ability to produce slim Docker images for Mithril nodes.

They also kept working on decentralizing the Mithril networks with the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking proof of concept, progressed with the adaptation of the Mithril client as a library, and worked on the deterministic computation of the UTXO set from the immutable files. 

Finally, they investigated some unreachability on the `release-mainnet` aggregator, and they enhanced the UI of the Mithril explorer.

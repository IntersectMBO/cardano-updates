## High level summary

Features that were implemented this period are mostly internal improvements to the quality of code. The only feature that stands out from this is the addition of a new query that allows users to learn the default vote for a particular Stake Pool Operator. Much improvement has also happened on the conformance testing side, as well as to the rest of the test suite.

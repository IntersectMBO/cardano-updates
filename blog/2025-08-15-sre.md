## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* With the exception of a few canary machines still running the legacy
cardano-node tracing system, the majority of IOE playground and mainnet
cardano-node machines are now running the new tracing system.

* [Adawallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adawallet) received a feature
upgrade to sign messages, enabling it to complete glacier drop claims for
adawallet accounts.  The [cardano-airgap](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-airgap)
image was updated to include this capability.


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Adawallet
* Bumps to node `10.5.1` for cardano-cli `10.11.0.0`, adds cardano-signer
  `v1.29.0` to the devShell, adds a yarn devShell, improves the cardano-hw-cli
  package by switching to default nodejs pkg and greatly simplifies the build.
  [adawallet-pr-22](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adawallet/pull/22)

* Add an adawallet `sign-msg` feature which signs with either payment or stake
  key, enabling glacier drop claims on adawallet accounts. Cleans up some more
  legacy cardano-hw-cli packaging and adds back bash auto-completion.

### Cardano-airgap
* Updates adawallet for `sign-msg` support for glacier drop and adds
  cardano-signer and misc support packages and services to the devShell and iso.

### Cardano-mainnet
* This PR primarily upgrades all machines to the cardano-node new tracing
  system. It provides alert, dashboard and nix module upgrades for compatibility
  with the new tracing system. This PR includes improvements from cardano-parts
  release `v2025-08-05`.  Additional details can be found in the PR
  description.

  container. Adds documentation on how to use the snapshot-converter within the
  image for changing ledger state type.

  the new cardano-node tracing system for deployed machines.  See the release
  notes for details.

* Updates cardano-signer to `v1.29.0` which allows for Byron era address claims
  for Midnight Glacier drop. Bumps mithril unstable and adds some flakeModule
  cluster options for more service granularity.

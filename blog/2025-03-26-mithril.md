## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team created the pre-release for the `2513.0-pre` distribution, which provides support for Cardano node v.10.2.1 and includes various bug fixes and improvements.

They implemented the aggregator's prototype 'slave' mode to support signer registration across multiple aggregators and started adapting the infrastructure to support it. They also focused on signing ancillary files in the Cardano database snapshots with an IOG key and worked on recording the origin of requests made to the aggregator API.

Finally, the team enhanced the handling of some aggregator functional errors to improve the accuracy of the signer metrics and kept refactoring the cryptographic library to improve clarity and maintainability.

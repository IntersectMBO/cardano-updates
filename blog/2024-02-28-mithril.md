## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released a new distribution, [`2408.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2408.0), which includes support for stake distribution and Mithril era markers retrieval in the Pallas chain observer, enhanced support for Conway era and Sanchonet network, along with bug fixes and performance improvements. Additionally, a breaking change has been introduced in the Mithril client CLI: the logs output are switched from `stdout` to `stderr` from version `0.7.0`, which has been announced in a [developer blog post](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2024/02/26/mithril-client-cli-output-breaking-change).


The team kept implementing the data type for certifying Cardano transactions within Mithril networks: they completed the support for the verification in the browser with the WASM client, they worked on enhancing the associated client CLI API, and they implemented smoke tests. Additionally, they have activated the signature of Cardano transactions on the `testing-sanchonet` network, and they have investigated a bug that prevents the signature of some transactions on this network.

Finally, the team worked on reorganizing the repository structure, fixed an issue with test folder generation on MacOS, and worked on some documentation improvements.

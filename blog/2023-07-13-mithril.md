## High level overview
The Mithril team created a new [`2327.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2327.0) distribution. They focused on preparing the beta launch on the `mainnet`: they tested the new production signer deployment model with the pioneer SPOs, they prepared an SPO on-boarding guide, and they kept working on the deployment and monitoring of the `mainnet` infrastructure. The team also worked on the implementation of a simple stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator. Additionally, they completed the refactoring of the interface to the cryptographic library. 

Finally, they fixed a bug that sporadically prevented the latest signer registration of a SPO to be used in the associated signing epoch, they fixed a bug in the epoch gap detection of the certificate chain in the aggregator, and worked on multiple other optimizations and bugs.

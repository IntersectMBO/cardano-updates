### High-level Summary

The team made good progress this week, with the release of version
0.15.0 marking a milestone, along with the monthly review including
both Mithril and Hydra work.  We addressed issues in smoke tests and
website publishing workflows, ensuring a more robust development
environment, and along the way included more "dogfooding" through the
use of Mithril to synchronize nodes in smoke tests.

### What did the team achieve this week

- Release of Version
   [0.15.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases/tag/0.15.0). This
   release enhances the overall stability and functionality of our
   product.
- Monthly Review and Community Demos
- Smoke Tests and Website Publishing Workflow Fixes: [#1246](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1246)
  - Resolved glitches in the website publishing workflows, enhancing
    the efficiency of our deployment processes.
- Integration of Mithril for Smoke Test Synchronization:  [#1252](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1252)
- Polishing of Hydra-Chess v0.1.0: [#1237](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1237)
  - Worked on polishing hydra-chess v0.1.0, treating it as an example
    application running on Hydra. This not only demonstrates the
    capabilities of our platform but also aims at providing a reference for future Hydra
    developers.

- Initiate work on the on-chain portion of incremental decommits

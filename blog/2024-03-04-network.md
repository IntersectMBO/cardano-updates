## High-level overview of [sprint 56][sprint-56]

### Cardano-Node, Cardano-API, Cardano-CLI

In the last sprint, the network team was designated to take the Release
Engineering Role, as the coming release contains mostly network advances.
Armando Santos has been making progress on it.  The following packages were
published to `CHaP`:

* `ouroboros-network-0.12.0.0`, [changelog][ouroboros-network-0.12.0.0];
* `ouroboros-network-protocols-0.8.0.0`, [changelog][ouroboros-network-protocols-0.8.0.0];
* `ouroboros-network-api-0.7.0.0`, [changelog][ouroboros-network-api-0.7.0.0];

and other `ouroboros-network` packages with minor changes.  The following
packages were also published:

* `ouroboros-consensus-0.16.0.0`, [changelog][ouroboros-consensus-0.16.0.0];
* `ouroboros-consensus-cardano-0.14.0.0`, [changelog][ouroboros-consensus-cardano-0.14.0.0];
* [`cardano-cli-8.20.3.0`][cardano-cli#615], [changelog][cardano-cli-8.20.3.0];
* [`cardano-api-8.39.2.0`][cardano-api#459], [changelog][cardano-api-8.39.2.0].

The work on `cardano-node` is in progress, see [cardano-node#5485]

We would like to thank Karl Knutsson ([CF]) for helping us to test the upcoming
`cardano-node` release.

### Ouroboros-Network

We continued working on `tx-submission`, [ouroboros-network#3311]

We started to execute an idea to put all configuration values used by the
diffusion layer `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion.Configuration` module. Currently,
default values are spread in different repositories (e.g. `cardano-node`,
`ouroboros-consensus`).  See [ouroboros-network#4805].

We restored how syncing works in bootstrap mode to get the same performance
characteristics, see [ouroboros-network#4809], [ouroboros-network#4810].

We started working on Outbound-Governor Genesis mode, see
[ouroboros-network#4813].

### Ouroboros-Consensus

We requested to modify how bulk-sync mode works to make it use the same
mechanism that the newly added `LedgerStateJudgement`. See
[ouroboros-consensus#958].

## Low-level summary

We also addressed a minor issue regarding tracing `LedgerStateJudgement`
changes, see [ouroboros-network#4816].

## High level summary

There were a few important performance improvements that had to do with:
* Avoiding redundant computation when constructing context for plutus scripts
* Reduction of memory overhead of some of the governance features
* Removal of a space leak that retained transactions in memory for longer than it was necessary

Other than improving performance we also focused on improving ledger interface and code
organization, as well as some minor improvements to the test suite.

### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team made significant progress on incremental decommits
by closing the last gaps and cleaning up the specification. They collected
scenarios and prepared for incremental commits, updated dependencies for
compatibility with cardano-node 9.0.0, and continued tidying up documentation.
Work continued on an easy spin-up of the getting-started demo via
process-compose. Additionally, the team onboarded a new contributor and held
an early design meeting about payment channels and Blockfrost. They also
refined the SDK wallet idea.

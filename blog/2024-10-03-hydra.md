### High-level summary

This month we continued our work on incremental commits and blockfrost. We
spent a bit of time conducting some experiments in ways to potentially improve
our CI build times, and completed an encouraging spike around using Raft (via
etcd) for our networking layer, among some other minor cleanups and
version bumps. Up next We will continue on with incremental commits and
blockfrost, as well as some items coming out of the Doom work, to improve our
memory efficiency, and finally we will aim to move to PlutusV3!

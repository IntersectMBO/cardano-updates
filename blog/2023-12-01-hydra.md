### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team conducted a packed Monthly Review meeting,
featuring demonstrations and the preparation of the monthly report. They
addressed flakiness in tests and enhanced the logs json schema,
improving overall test reliability. Additionally, the team successfully
built MacOS ARM64 (`aarch64-darwin`) binaries in CI, expanding platform
support. They further improved the network configuration by detecting
incompatible persisted states, contributing to overall system
robustness. Finally, the team released version 0.14.0, highlighting
their commitment to delivering regular updates and improvements.

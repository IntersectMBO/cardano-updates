### Framework improvements:
- Make cardano-submit-api REST API service available and run corresponding regression tests by default
- Update cabal build testing for 8.0.0
- Add support for testing governance SPO poll
- Use Poetry for Python dependency management
- Check status of known GH issues during tests runtime and finish the test accordingly
- Generate topology files with both IP addresses and DNS names
- Log issues like failure to start a cluster instance and report errors during tests runtime

### Testing improvements
- Add rollback testing:
    1. global consensus is reached after rollback, in situation where less than `securityParam` blocks were produced since cluster split
    1. global consensus is not reached when more than `securityParam` blocks were produced, and the result is permanent fork
- Add tests to governance SPO poll commands

## High level summary

This time around we continued on testing the Conway era and improving our conformance
tests. Thanks to this extensive testing we found and fixed a few more bugs in the Conway
implementation. We fixed bugs related to DRep expiry and the choice of correct threshold for
the committee voting. One important feature that was implemented is ignoring the
minimun committee size during the bootstrap phase, in order to avoid a deadlock situation in
case that enough committeee members were to resign. We've also improved the correctness of
our CDDL specification and improved the safety by restricting some of the types of
protocol parameters.

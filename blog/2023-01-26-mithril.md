## High level overview
The Mithril team released a new [`2302.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2302.0) distribution that activates the optimization of the snapshot digest computation on the signer and aggregator nodes. They have implemented a backward/forward compatibility mechanism for handling seamless soft updates of the Mithril networks without using synchronous updates when possible. The team also worked on the proof of concept to rely on an on-chain transaction to synchronously trigger the era switch of all the signer and aggregator nodes.

Finally, they finished upgrading the devnet, fixed the flakiness issues in the end-to-end tests of the CI, and upgraded the SPO documentation to set up a Mithril signer node.

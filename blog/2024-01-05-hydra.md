### High-level summary

In between the end-of-year holidays, the Hydra team completed the implementation
of the Conway support feature, fixed a minor bug that was hindering tests from
running on MacOS, and addressed a regression in the protocol-parameter formats
used by the `hydra-node`. They also worked on off-chain code for incremental
decommits, specifically focusing on transaction creation. Furthermore, they
conducted a spike on implementing a Chess game using Hydra, with an experience
report provided.

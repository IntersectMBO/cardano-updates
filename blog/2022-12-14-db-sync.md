The DBSync team continued testing release `13.1.0.0`. The QA team has reported that no issues have
been found. The DBSync team also worked on cherry-picks back to master and on fixing bugs.

## Lower level summary

- Release is cherry-picked back to master, which uses the new rollback mechanism which uses
reverse indexes, same as the release
[#1320](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/pull/1320)
This also fixes a bug number of issues on master.
- Depenencies upgrade and CHaP integration
[#1324](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/pull/1324)
- AdaPots fix [#1323](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/pull/1323). This
fixes an issue where the per epoch AdaPots didn't match the epoch boundary, but
they also included changes from the first block of the epoch.
- Deposits Event fix [#3212](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3212). This pr
adjusts the Deposits ledger events, so that it can be better used by db-sync. This can reduce the
number of queries that db-sync does during syncing an make syncing faster.

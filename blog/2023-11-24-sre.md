## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on cardano environment improvements and general environment maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:
* The cardano-node nixos service now supports SIGHUP p2p topology reloading when the `useSystemdReload` option is enabled

## Lower level summary

### Capkgs
* Update cardano-db-sync and offchain-metadata-tools package paths and/or references: [capkgs-compare](https://github.com/input-output-hk/capkgs/compare/994696f...3ce364f)

### Cardano-node
* Optionally have cardano-node nixos service utilize SIGHUP p2p topology reload: [cardano-node-pull-5537](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/5537)
  * Creates a useSystemdReload bool option for the cardano-node nixos service
  * This will move the topology file(s) to `/etc/cardano-node/topology-$i.yaml` and inject systemd reload hooks for p2p configured cardano-node instances
  * Moving topology files to `/etc` also allows for manual topology updates when a quick test is needed and full service re-deployment isn't desired

### Cardano-parts
* Adds a metadata server profile and a number of other features and improvements: [cardano-parts-pull-20](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts/pull/20)
  * Adds a new metadata-service profile
  * Adds metadata service and pkg configuration options for cardano-groups to utilize the metadata-server profile
  * Adds a cardano-webserver profile for multiple virtualHosts and TLS ACME server aliases for a cluster's static needs, with each cached behind varnish
  * Adds extra node list producers and public producers for cardano-node-topology profile
  * Adds delegation amounts to cardano-postgres psql prepared query show_pools_block_history_in_epoch
  * Adds select systemd metrics reporting to grafana-agent profile
  * Adds a bookRelay multivalue DNS option to disambiguate with groupRelay multivalue DNS
  * Adds an opsLib library to the cardano-parts lib flakeModule and refactors some common code into it
  * Adds support for sops secret traversing from target path up instead of cwd up, thereby supporting secrets use-cases outside of the repo
  * Adds job-gen-env-config for both release and pre-release configuration files to support configuration book generation
  * Adds support for grafana recording rules in the template files
  * Improves cardano-group profile handling of producers with respect to multiple instance nodes
  * Improves grafana-agent profile metrics handling for multi-instance cardano-node servers
  * Improves smash service preStart handling while waiting for a node socket
  * Updates Justfile for ERA_CMD demo support
  * Migrates default grafana cloud node exporter, varnish alert and recording rules to grafana alert and recording rule templates
  * Defaults to using an updated systemd reload nixos service feature for p2p networks in cardano-group profile
  * Defaults cardano-postgres profile psqlrc use to false

### Cardano-playground
* Adds a new testnet metadata server, cluster webserver, and other improvements: [cardano-playground-pull-6](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-playground/pull/6)
  * Adds a new metadata server
  * Adds a new webserver for the cluster's static virtualhost needs
  * Adds support for sops secret traversing from target path up instead of cwd up, thereby supporting secrets use-cases outside of the repo
  * Adds systemd metrics monitoring to the cluster
  * Resizes sanchonet machines to support the growing chain
  * Completes migration of preprod from world
  * Updates groups to utilize both bookRelay and groupRelay multivalue DNS attributes
  * Updates Justfile for ERA_CMD demo support
  * Defaults to using an updated systemd reload nixos service feature for p2p networks in cardano-group profile
  * Migrates book static code to playground from world, with refactor, cleanup and updates
  * Migrates default grafana cloud node exporter, varnish alert and recording rules to declarative grafana alert and recording rules

### Offchain-metadata-tools
* Adds db password option with obfuscation plus misc improvements: [offchain-metadata-tools-pull-61](https://github.com/input-output-hk/offchain-metadata-tools/pull/61)
  * Adds db password connection option and obfuscates passwords in output for metadata server, sync, webhook services
  * Updates the nixos service for metadata-webhook service to optionally use an environmentFile for secrets: cfg.environmentFile
  * Moves from std use in the nix flake to standard flake schema
  * Fixes hydra CI failures
  * Builds update-docs in hydra to avoid long local build times
  * Removes deprecated tullia
  * Removes deprecated check-hydra from pkgs
  * Removes deprecated bors files and references

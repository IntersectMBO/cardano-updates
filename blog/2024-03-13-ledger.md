## High level summary

Focus has been on testing: adding tests and improving our testing framework to make it easier to write tests for various Conway features. 
We also did some cleanup and reorganisation of code, to make it more manageable and easier to release. 
We have started work on Hardfork Initiation: support for intra-era hardfork initiation and necessary updates the SPO stake distribution calculation.

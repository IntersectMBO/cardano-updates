## High-level overview of [sprint 68][sprint-68]

We conducted an investigation whether the new proposed `typed-protocols`
version (see [typed-protocols#52] introduces any performance regression.  No
regression was found when running a `cardano-node` (`v9.1.0` vs a modified
version using the new `typed-protocols` API) the benchmarking cluster.  Also no
regression was observed when syncing mainnet.  The graph below shows
accumulated size of block downloaded over time for both nodes:

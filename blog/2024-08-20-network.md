## High-level overview of [sprint 68][sprint-68]

### Peer Sharing

Karl Knutsson ([CF]) produces graphs which show how peer sharing usage expands on mainnet.

<div align="center">

</div>

Private relays in the last graph are relays which we are not certain that are
registered on the chain.

### Typed Protocols

We conducted an investigation whether the new proposed `typed-protocols`
version (see [typed-protocols#52] introduces any performance regression.  No
regression was found when running a `cardano-node` (`v9.1.0` vs a modified
version using the new `typed-protocols` API) the benchmarking cluster.  Also no
regression was observed when syncing mainnet.  The graph below shows
accumulated size of block downloaded over time for both nodes:

* [ekg-forward#33]
* [cardano-node#5956] - `cardano-node` version using new `typed-protocols` API

### cardano-cli ping

Fixed a bug in which `cardano-cli ping` exited with wrong exit code when a wrong network magic was supplied, see [ouroboros-network#4865].

`cardano-cli ping` will also now report the remote IP address and port when querying the tip:
```
> cardano-cli ping -h backbone.mainnet.cardanofoundation.org -p3001 -t -j -q | jq
{
  "tip": [
    {
      "addr": "2a01:2a8:a23d:16::17",
      "blockNo": 10699400,
      "hash": "f37649c4a6ae0c8b208da7c46d4e04312518969e612af0a8dbfdadcbd7180dd2",
      "port": 3001,
      "rtt": 0.013192945,

    },

    },
    {

      "rtt": 0.034663209,
      "slotNo": 131991843
    }
 ]
}
```
See [ouroboros-network#4931].

### Tx-Submission

We continued writing tests for the new `tx-submission` application.

We started extending `typed-protocols` codec to have access to both raw bytes
and decoded transactions in the `tx-submission` mini-protocol.  See
[ouroboros-network#4934].

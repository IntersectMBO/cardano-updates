## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the mock DMQ node to support end-to-end testing of decentralized signature diffusion. They worked on resolving a circular dependency issue with the operational certificate in the KES signer module and completed the upgrade to Cardano node v.10.5. Additionally, the team continued collaborating with the innovation team on prototyping a SNARK proving circuit for Mithril certificates.

Finally, they worked on prototyping a Mithril/Cardano bundle in a Docker image, and made progress refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

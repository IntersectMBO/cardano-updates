### High-level summary

The last few weeks have seen a solid amount of work and changes to the
user-facing side of Hydra; namely great progress on incremental commits and
using Aiken for our commit validator which has [yielded size/cost
savings](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1680#issue-2565734963).
This has also allowed us to support PlutusV3 validators and keep up to date
with the cardano-api. We also made a breaking change (improvement) to the
server output `SnapshotConfirmed` to make it easier to work with signed
snapshots. Finally, we made good progress on blockfrost support by adding an
option to follow the chain via blockfrost, instead of through a cardano-node.
Next up we continue our focus on incremental commits and general improvements,
while planning the next release.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team enabled incremental certification for the Cardano database (Cardano node database v2) on the `release-mainnet` network.

The team progressed with the DMQ node implementation by completing the signature consumer and processor in the aggregator for continuous signature handling, and introduced a mechanism to record the origin of signatures. Work also began on supporting UTxO-HD in the aggregator, signer, and client.

Finally, the team addressed bug fixes, improved the CI workflows, and continued refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

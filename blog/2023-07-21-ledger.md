## High level summary

Our focus was on planning and implementing Conway features that we would like to see deployed and running on Sanchonet. 
All members of the ledger team participated in the CIP-1694 workshop and had an in-person meeting, where we discussed plans forward for the Conway era.
We also investigated some transaction validation issues that occurred on preview with the latest node (for 8.2 release).
Additionally, we did some preparatory work that will help us define the types we need for Plutus V3 and integrate with the new version when it will become available.
We also made progress on the constraint-based generators, which can now generate valid transactions and ledger states. 

## What we achieved 

* [[pull-3521]] [[pull-3554]] Improved Governance model (GovernanceProcedures, ProposalProcedure)
* [[pull-3520]] Improved Governance-related naming (Renamed Tally to Gov and VDel to GovCert ) 
* [[pull-3531]] Refactored and simplified code interacting with Plutus
* [[pull-3558]] Fixed a bug that was breaking validation on preview, related to refernce inputs witnesses. We backported and released the fix. 
* [[pull-3550]] For Conway to run on Sanchonet, we updated the era Translation to remove zero-ADA outputs. This was necessary because such outputs exist on mainnet, but in Conway they are not allowed.
* [[pull-3551]] [[pull-3546]] [[pull-3472]] Updated tools and added some small improvements 
* [[issue-3146]] [[pull-3498]] Introduced Conway protocol parameters 
* [[issue-2948]] [[pull-3499]] Implemented ConwayGenesis with the new protocol parameters

## What is currently in progress

* [[issue-3494]] [[pull-3495]] Implement returning of proposal deposits
* [[issue-3436]] [[pull-3523]] Implement transferring lovelace from UTxO to treasury
* [[issue-3509]] [[pull-3552]] Add script-support for the committee hot key
* [[issue-3532]] [[pull-3556]] Add script-support for the constitution
* [[issue-3543]] [[pull-3557]] Improve the 'new committee' governance action by specifying the members to be replaced, expiration epoch of new members and adding script-support

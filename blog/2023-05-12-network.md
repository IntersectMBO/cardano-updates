## High level summary

We started working on a new way to switch between root & ledger peers (see
below).  We continued to work on `eclipse-evasion`.  We merged changes to
Handshake contributed by Galois Inc.  We made improvements to our tests (fixed
a flaky test, added cddl specs for `NodeToNodeVersionData` and
`NodeToClientVersionData`).  We improved our CI and automated the process of
releasing new package version to `CHaP`.

## Detailed summary

We continued to work on testing `eclipse-evasion`.

We came up with an idea to limit how full node wallets relay on root peers
(currently operated by IOG, in future also CF and Emurgo).  We designed
a switch to use ledger peers if the node tip is close enough to the current
time.  For more details see [#4530].

We merged changes to the handshake mini-protocol which allow one to query
server's `node-to-node` / `node-to-client` parameters.  We are grateful to
Galois Inc. for implementing it, [#4256] and [#4538].  We published new version
of packages to CHaP [chap-#253].

We added `DiffusionError` wrapper.  Thanks to it, `ouroboros-consensus` will
not duplicate diffusion errors messages in the log, [#4537].

We fixed an issue which caused one of our tests to be flaky, [#4515].

We added cddl tests for `NodeToNodeVersionData` and `NodeToClientVersionData`:
[#4540], [#4544] (in review).

We wrote scripts which will help us release packages as well as verify that we
released all the package necessary to build the newest set of packages,
[#4542].

We renamed the consensus startup tracer and make sure it doesn't log
`ExitSuccess` exceptions, [consensus-#71].

We reviewed PR which adds `RawBearer` API, [#4395].

We made series of improvements to our CI:
* [#4539]: we don't need to install cryptographic libraries in CI;
* [#4545]: Javier Sagredo (consensus) cleaned up CI after `consensus` moved
  to a new repo;
* [#4546]: we switched to use [GitHub merge queues][mq];
* [#4549]: we made it possible to trigger building haddocks manually;
* [#4553]: we fixed and enhanced caching of building dependencies.

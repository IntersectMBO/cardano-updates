## High level summary

Same as with the prior report we are focusing on testing Conway features and conformance
testing. One bug was discovered and fixed as a result of this testing, which would only
have affected Conway functionality until after the bootstrap phase is over. We also
finished fully defining Conway CDDL specification in Haskell.

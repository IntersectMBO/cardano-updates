## High level overview
The Mithril team has released a new distribution [`2337.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2337.0), which includes the following enhancements: support for `zstandard` compression of snapshot archives, support for the Cardano node version in snapshot metadata, and support for recording snapshot download statistics in the aggregator.

They also completed the refactoring and standardization of the errors in the Mithril nodes and published an [Architectural decision record](https://mithril.network/doc/adr/6) on the documentation website. Additionally, they kept working on adding Cloudflare protection to the infrastructure.

Finally, they have fixed a performance issue on the stress test tool for the aggregator, and they have made some improvements on the documentation for SPOs.

## High level overview
The Mithril team has released a new distribution [`2337.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2337.0) which brings the following enhancements: support for the `zstandard` compression of snapshot archives, support for Cardano node version in the snapshot metadata, and support for recording snapshot download statistics in the aggregator.

They have completed the refactoring and standardizition of the errors in the Mithril nodes, and an [Architectural Decision Record](https://mithril.network/doc/adr/6) has been published on the documentation website. Additionally, they have kept working on adding Cloudflare protection to the infrastructure.

Finally, they have fixed a performance issue on the stress test tool for the aggregator, and they have made some improvements on the documentation for SPOs.

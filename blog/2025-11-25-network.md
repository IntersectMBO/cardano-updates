## Overview of spint [100][sprint-100] and [101][sprint-101]

### Cardano Incident

On November 12th, Cardano experienced a fork due to a bug in ledger
(de-)serialisation.  Some nodes accepted an invalid tx, while others rejected
it, leading to a fork of the chain.

The network team worked closely with the other Cadano teams, Intersect, Cardano
Foundation, Emurgo, and stake pool operators to monitor and resolve the
incident.

The network layer was not affected by the incident, and its resiliency played
a role in the recovery of the network.  We identified some areas that can
further improve the network layer's robustness in such situations, and we'll be
working on addressing these issues.

### Churn Mitigation

We rolled out a churn mitigation included in the latest `cardano-node-10.5` and
`10.6` releases.  This change ensures the speed of churn of hot peers is at
least the speed of churn for established peers, and the speed of churn of the
established peers is at least the speed of churn of known peers.   This way, we
avoid a situation where, over a long period of time, established peers will
accumulate already tried hot peers, and cold peers will accumulate already
tried established peers.  See [#5238] for more details.

The issue was identified using [CF]'s __[cardano-ignite]__ tool, with analysis
provided by [Karl Knutsson].

### DMQ-Node

We are initiating a public repository for `dmq-node` to host its codebase.

We removed the KES evolution configuration; as a consequence, the genesis file
option is no longer needed in the configuration of `dmq-node`, see [#5244].

### Peer Selection Improvements

Refined peer selection for local root peers behind firewalls: instead of
polling, it now waits for incoming connections and reuses them outbound. See
[#5241] for details.

## High level summary

Recently QA found a bug in P2P code, which results in busy loops.  We added one
fix to `1.35.6` release, another one will likely be part of next release.  The
first one is already included in `ouroboros-network-0.3.0.1` release.  These
bugs could only affect nodes which are out of sync and thus should not impose
risk on well maintained nodes on mainnet.  We also advertise to deploy at most
one of the relays as a P2P node, which shields from possible consequences.

We recently finished design phase of eclipse evasion and we started
implementing it (see [issue #3886] for progress).

Galois finished implementing Handshake extension which will allow to query
network protocol versions (see [pr #4256]).

We also recently released a newer set of network packages to be integrated with
`cardano-node` `master` branch, this includes:
    * monoidal-synchronisation-0.1.0.2
    * cardano-client-0.1.0.2
    * network-mux-0.3.0.0
    * ouroboros-network-api-0.1.0.0
    * ouroboros-network-protocols-0.2.0.0
    * ouroboros-network-testing-0.2.0.1
    * ouroboros-network-mock-0.1.0.0
    * ouroboros-network-framework-0.3.0.0
    * ouroboros-network-0.4.0.0 (it doesn't not yet include the fix we included
      in `0.3.0.1`)

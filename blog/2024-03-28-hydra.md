### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team conducted the monthly review meeting and investigated
a broken head situation. The team slightly improved conway forward compatibility
in `explorer` / `hydra-node`, enhanced `hydra-cluster --devnet` which allows e2e
testing of `kupo`, extended smoke test to also include committing ADA into the
head, documented the anticipated behavior of incremental decommits, and added
decommits to the tutorial.

### What did the team achieve this week

- Conducted the monthly review meeting (link to recording already?)
- Investigated a broken head situation [\#1374](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1374)
- Slightly improved conway forward compatibility in explorer / hydra-node [\#1373](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1373)
- Busy `hydra-cluster --devnet` sandbox which allows e2e testing of `kupo` [\#1378](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1378)
- Extended smoke test to also include committing ADA into the head [\#1377](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1377)
- Documented the anticipated behavior of incremental [decommits](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/commit/60d55e8bb5a75c77647e17e44f22a754fa33ac0f) and added decommits to [tutorial](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/commit/efc2809909636b6925b39dcb0810010fcd4a84c7)
- Another write-up of how the incremental commit/decommit could work (without needing merkle trees or L2/L1 interleaving) [on this issue](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/199#issuecomment-2018001381)

### What are the goals of next week

- Complete the written monthly report
- Update our head and `hydraw` instance to `master` (a release candidate)
- Complete the improved `/commit` endpoint to unblock users
- Release `0.16.0` (likely without incremental decommits)
- Reproduce close \> contest \> contest scenarios using stateful testing

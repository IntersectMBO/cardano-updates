## High-level overview of [sprint 47][sprint-47]

### Bootstrap Peers

We continued to review the process of bootstrap peers, see [ouroboros-network#4555]

### CI / Tests

We investigated our CI issues. We found a memory leak in `typed-protocols`
function used for testing codecs which triggered out of memory manager (OOM) on
some platforms ([typed-protocols#43]); we also found a bug in the connection manager which resulted in CI
`timeouts` (see [connection-manager-fix]).  

### KeepAlive client

We found two small issues with the keep-alive client, which were addressed
by Karl Knutsson ([Cardano Foundation][CF]), [ouroboros-network#4689].

### Galois

We merged two large PRs prepared by [Galois]:
* [inspect `error` call sites][ouroboros-network#4660]
* [implement micro benchmarks for `PeerMetrics`][ouroboros-network#4663]

### Cardano Network Service Assurance (CNSA)

Galois made the following progress on CNSA:
* a simple [InfuxDB] database backend has been added;
* the documentation has been updated;
* internal improvements to the code;
* progress on a new "CSNA analysis" that provides, for each sampler node, the
  block download throughput in bytes over time.

### New CHaP Release

We cut a new release of `ouroboros-netowrk` packages to `CHaP`: [chap#547]

## More details

### CI / Tests

We improved the memory footprint of some of our tests by analysing a stream of
`IOSim` traces without retaining them, see [ouroboros-network#4696]

As a safety measure, we introduced an upper bound for heap memory used by test
artefacts in our `nix` tests.  We use `200MB` limit for all tests except for
`network-mux` tests which use `350MB` limit, see [ouroboros-network#4702].

We refactored one of our tests to use ephemeral ports thus allowing it to
run concurrently, see [ouroboros-network#4702].

We merged [ouroboros-network#4623] which fixes a bunch of test failures.
* [inbound-governor: connection leak][ouroboros-network#4694]
* [connection-manager: assertion failure][ouroboros-network#4607]
* [not released connection][ouroboros-network#4605]

All of them were due to a bug in test logic rather than a bug in production
code.

### Release Process

We updated our release process & associated scripts, see
[ouroboros-network#4705].

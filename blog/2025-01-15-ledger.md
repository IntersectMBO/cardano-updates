## High level summary

Due to the holiday season this time around the Ledger report will be from a period of 6 weeks
instead of the usual 2 weeks. That being said, this is also the time when everyone goes on
vacation. Therefore the report is larger than usual, but not as big as if two periods of reporting
were skipped at a usual time.

Most of the effort was spent on polishing up some of the Conway features before the upcoming Plomin
hard fork that is scheduled to happen some time in January, as well as continued testing of the
Conway features in order to improve our confidence in the upcoming hard fork. Because of this effort
we nailed a couple of serious bugs, fixes for which are included in the latest release, which is why
an upgrade for all SPOs to the newest version of `cardano-node-10.1.4` is highly advisable.

Another big allocation of effort was towards tackling some of the technical debt accrued over the years.

The most significant change by far in this report is the removal of crypto parameterization from
every era definition in Ledger. This change was not only a huge simplification for the Ledger
codebase, but it will be just as big of a simplification for all of the downstream users of
Ledger. Most importantly, this change will finally allow us to switch to the newer version of the
GHC compiler, because it addresses the performance regression that the newer compiler version was
susceptible to.

One more major accomplishment that we can share is a drastic change to how serialization of UTxO
happens in the ledger state. This change is planned to solve a long standing problem with blocks
being missed due to the garbage collector kicking in at the time when the ledger snapshot was being
created. Moreover this change will have a significant positive impact on UTxOHD performance when it
will finally be released.

Another big milestone, with respect to tackling technical debt is a release of our cryptographic
library, which was undergoing some major changes throughout the last couple of years. It was finally
released and integrated into Ledger with all of the other downstream components set to follow.

We can also finally conclude our work on defining CDDL specification in Haskell as is it is now
completely generated from a Haskell definition for all of the eras. Thanks to this effort we not
only have a better confidence in the accuracy of our CDDL specification, due to extra type checking
and testing we now get thanks to Haskell, but it also reduces duplication and complexity that usedq
to stem from manual serialization specification definition for every Ledger era.

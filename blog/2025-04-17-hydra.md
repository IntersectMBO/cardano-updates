### High-level summary

The team accomplished quite a lot of things, notably the Withdraw Zero trick
is now possible, we have documentation for snapshot side-loading, and we have
fixed a number of bugs with deposits. We are now focused on our next big
release, a Blockfrost-based chain layer, and supporting the Glacier drop.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team worked on integrating the Haskell DMQ node with the Mithril nodes. They also completed the preparatory phase and started to work on the first phase of decentralization of the configuration parameters. They kept working on supporting multiple proof systems and on the implementation plan for Mithril succinct proofs with a SNARK-friendly version of the STM cryptographic library.

Finally, the team worked on replacing some vulnerable Rust dependencies that provide support for YAML parsing, and they made progress refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

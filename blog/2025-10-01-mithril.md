## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team focused on integrating the Haskell DMQ node with Mithril nodes. They also finished the preparatory phase and started the first phase of decentralizing configuration parameters. Work continued on supporting multiple proof systems and developing an implementation plan for Mithril succinct proofs using a SNARK-friendly version of the STM cryptographic library.

Finally, the team replaced vulnerable Rust dependencies for YAML parsing and made progress refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

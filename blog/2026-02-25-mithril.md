## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing new succinct proofs. The team completed the lottery target value computation for SNARK, updated the protocol parameters to SNARK-friendly values, prepared the SNARK circuit refactoring, and removed the off-circuit module from the Halo2 circuit. They also continued working on SNARK pre-aggregation primitives and on signer authentication for SNARK, on the full review of the recursive circuit prototype, and on the technical report for the recursive Halo2 circuit.

Additionally, the team continued work on the new certification for Cardano blocks and transactions, implementing the transaction membership prover and proof routes in the aggregator REST API. They also started preparing the release of the `2608` distribution.

Finally, they fixed a bug related to a breaking change of the snapshot converter in Cardano node v.10.6.2 and fixed flaky unit tests in the SNARK circuit.

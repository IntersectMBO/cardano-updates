## High level summary

The Ledger team has been shifting focus from implementing Conway related features to
testing. For this reason there is a very little amount features that are reported this
time aorund. Notable Conway related changes are a specialized ledger query for getting
Constitutional Committee state and prevention of submitting proposal procedures that have
no valid path to enactment.

Testing related work was mainly on a constraint base system as well as on roundtrip
serialization. As a result of this extra testing a bug in Conway Genesis serialization
was eliminated.

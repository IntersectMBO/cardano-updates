## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on cardano environment improvements and general
environment maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:
* Cardano-node 8.7.3 is now generally deployed to all testnet and mainnet environments
  managed by coretech SRE
* Dbsync and node stack process-compose jobs are now available from
  cardano-parts for users running `nix >= 2.17.0` and nix `experimental-features
  = nix-command flakes fetch-closure`
* These can be run with:
  ```
   nix run github:input-output-hk/cardano-parts#run-process-compose-node-stack
   nix run github:input-output-hk/cardano-parts#run-process-compose-dbsync-$NETWORK
  ```

## High level summary

Over the past couple of weeks, the team continued working on LSM and KES agent integration, as well as Peras implementation. On the Leios prototyping front, the team is currently [drafting](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/pull/498) a section in the Leios CIP focused on the new mini-protocols.

Two small improvements to Genesis tracing and metrics were also introduced: [#6306](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6306) and [#1628](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/pull/1628).

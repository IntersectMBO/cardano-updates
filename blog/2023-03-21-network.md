## High level summary

In the last spring we released `cardano-node-1.35.6` with dynamic P2P
functionality.

We released `cardano-ping-0.1.0.0` package to `CHaP`.  `cardano-ping` is no
longer available as a standalone binary, but instead it will become part of
`cardano-cli` (see [#4664])

We are testing `cardano-node` with peer sharing functionality ([#4019]).

We are working on _eclipse evasion_.  We added new class of peers: big ledger
peers to the outbound governor, implemented tests and fixed found issues
([#4462]).  We also made the information if a given peer plays the role of
a big ledger peer to the mini-protocols.  This will allow to modify
mini-protocol applications for such peers.   As part of this functionality we
refactored some core types in the network code which simplifies exposed API.

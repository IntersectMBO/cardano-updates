### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team worked on aligning the specification with the current
incremental decommit implementation, added decommit to model-based tests and
also discussed the incremental commit protocol extension with researchers. The
team also updated to `cardano-api 8.40` and tests against `cardano-node 8.9.0`,
which unblocked a possible release and re-enabled smoke tests on public
networks. They also groomed a new `/commit` endpoint interface from a user
discussion and discussed restructuring of the Hydra documentation. The team also
prepared a `Conway`-supporting `hydra-node` on branch `lc/conway-support` for
early adopters (Hi @Juantxu and @ash ðŸ‘‹). Some internal refactoring prepared for
upcoming streaming plugins by SundaeLabs and minor fixes to the TUI and
`hydra-explorer` rounded off the week.

### What did the team achieve this week

-   Aligned specification with current incremental decommit implementation and added Decommit to model based tests.
-   Discussed and explored further on incremental commits with researchers.
-   Refactored `Event -> Input` [#1348](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1348) to prepare for streaming plugins [#1325](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1325).
-   Minor fixes to the TUI and hydra-explorer clients.
-   Updated to `cardano-node 8.9.0` and `cardano-api 8.40` - this unblocked a possible release and re-enabled smoke tests on public networks.
-   Groomed new `/commit` endpoint interface [#1350](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1350) from a user discussion [#1337](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/1337).
-   Discussed restructuring of the Hydra documentation [#1349](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1349).
-   Prepared a `Conway`-supporting `hydra-node` on branch `lc/conway-support` [#1178](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1178) (will be merged only after the hard-fork).

### What are the goals of next week

-   Prepare a PR for Kupo using new Hydra transaction format (to prepare for 0.16.0 release)
-   Review and merge streaming plugins [#1325](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1325)
-   Improve the `/commit` endpoint to unblock users
-   Test corner cases of incremental decommit transaction traces

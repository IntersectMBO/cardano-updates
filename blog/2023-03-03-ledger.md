## High level summary

We have focused the last two weeks on CIP-1694, integration of the last several months of ledger
work into consensus and node, and testing infrastrutcture that we will use in the conway ledger era.

## Low level summary

### Conway rules

We made a major update to the conway era so that the implementation is now in sync with the spec
with respect to the ratification and enactment logic.

See the notes in [pull-3291] for more details.

### Constraint based generators

This week we hit a major milestone in our efforts to build out better property based testing
support for the main ledger properties.
The new constraint based generators can now generate full ledger states with what is probably
very close to the real constraints (if anything, it is under constrained).
Next we will work on generating a transaction in the context of a ledger state, which would allow
us to actually start using these generators for real tests.

See [pull-3219].

### Preparing a release, now with proper versioning

After quite some time, we are ready to release a version of ledger that will work with a new
version of consensus, using CHaPs.

See [pull-3308].

### Technical debt

* We cleaned up the redeemer serialization code (to prevent future mistakes). See [pull-3269].
* We added a note to the Alonzo spec, specifying that the transaction inputs are
  lexicographically ordered in the Plutus script context. See [pull-3306].
* We fixed a problem with the address deserialiazation
  (we mistakenly fixed a bug in the Babbage era which cannot be fixed until Conway).
  See [pull-3307].
* We fixed a problem with our nix build. See [pull-3311].
* We fixed a problem with our `NoThunks` tests. See [pull-3310].
* We improved our nightly tests. See [pull-3316].

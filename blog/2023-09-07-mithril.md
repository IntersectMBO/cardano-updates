## High level overview
The Mithril team has released a new distribution [`2335.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2335.0) which brings enhancements to the client: support for simultaneous downloading and unpacking of the snapshot archives, support for one line command restoration of the latest snapshot, and availability of machine readable progress information.

They have also worked on snapshots enhancements: implementation of the `zstandard` compression to produce smaller archives, and providing the version of the Cardano node used to create the archive in the snapshot artifacts. They have completed the second phase of the implementation of the stress test tool to benchamrk the aggregator. Additionally, they have kept working on refactoring and standardizing errors in the Mithril nodes.

Finally, they have worked on adding Cloudflare protection to the infrastructure, and they have fixed some bugs that occurred during restoration of a snapshot by a client.

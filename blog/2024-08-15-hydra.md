### High-level summary

We fixed a bug when keeping a Head alive during the Conway hardfork on
preview, by adding some code to handle the cost calculations. We also released
0.18.0 featuring incremental decommits. We continued on with some items
supporting Hydra Doom and general maintenance of our code to be compatibile
with our upstream dependencies. Next, we'll be looking to release our new
homepage, and carry on with network testing, and general upgrades to our
ledger and dependencies.

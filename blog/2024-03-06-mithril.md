## High level overview

This week the Mithril team kept implementing the data type for certifying Cardano transactions within Mithril networks: they worked on adapting the Mithril explorer to support Cardano transactions verification, they started implementing a more efficient signing scheme for the transactions, they stabilized the type names in the API, and they kept investigating a bug that prevents the signature of some transactions of Conway era. Additionally, they have completed the first version of the Prometheus monitoring endpoint for the signer.

Finally, the team fixed a bug occuring in the publication of the `npm` packages of the client, enhanced the HTTP tests of the aggregator, and kept working on the KES period computation in the Pallas chain observer.

## High-level overview of [sprint 65][sprint-65]

Karl Knutsson ([CF]) fixed a bug which prevented a node using bootstrap peers
to sync using them, for a more detailed description see [ouroboros-network#4899].

Earlier this year we fixed bugs in `IOSimPOR` which prevent us from using it in
`ouroboros-network` ([io-sim#153], [io-sim#159]); since
[ouroboros-network#4872] was merged we have a large number of tests that are
using `IOSimPOR`'s schedule exploration.  In the last sprint we fixed
some bugs discovered by `IOSimPOR` in `ouroboros-network`:

* **Block Fetch Client assertion failure** - [ouroboros-network#4890],
* **Connection manager's invalid transition** - [ouroboros-network#4891].

We continued working on new `tx-submission` logic: [ouroboros-network#3311] as
well as on Genesis.  The work on Genesis is split in a few PRs which are
currently in review process:

* **Big Ledger Peer Targets for Genesis** - [ouroboros-network#4832]
* **Feed peer selection governor with big ledger peers obtained from a snapshot** - [ouroboros-network#4850]
* **Introduction of serialization instances in support of ledger peer snapshot** - [ouroboros-network#4851]
* **Verification of big ledger peer snapshot file** - [ouroboros-network#4888]


## High-level overview of [sprint 64][sprint-64]

Karl Knutsson ([CF]) modified peer sharing behaviour to not share peers whith
which connections failed, see [ouroboros-network#4883] for more details.

We fixed inbound governor counters tracer, see [ouroboros-network#4885].

## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Blockperf new tracing system compatibility PRs have been merged to master.

* Cardano-node binary release artifacts have been cleaned up, removing some
irrelevant binaries and adding `tx-generator` for the upcoming node `10.5.1`
release.

* SRE has undertaken governance activities on preview and preprod networks
to refresh the constitutional committee expiry and reduce committee minimum
size to 3.  This process has completed on preview and will complete soon on
preprod.


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Blockperf
* Adds a publishing control bool via env var `BLOCKPERF_PUBLISH` which defaults
  to True if unset. This supports the use case where published metrics to CF
  don't make sense, such as temp testnet machines, but blockperf metrics would
  still be valuable to scrape for internal review. If publishing is disabled, the
  startup requirements are loosened; for example, cert key declarations are not
  required. This PR also adds the `preview` network.
  [blockperf-pr-31](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/blockperf/pull/31)

* Supports new node tracing in a backward compatible manner: adds support for
  new node tracing system; adds checks for new node tracing system config; adds a
  boolean env var tracing system selector, `BLOCKPERF_LEGACY_TRACING`, defaulting
  to `True`; updates the readme to reflect the new options and operating modes.

### Cardano-airgap
* Makes boot relevant files available at predictable paths. An external grub
  can use these to load the iso image from block device or local boot storage
  accessible file path
  [cardano-airgap-pr-5](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-airgap/pull/5)


### Cardano-node
* This PR adds `tx-generator` and removes several release binaries. To do so,
  musl builds needed to be added and git hash stamping was applied to set commit
  version in the binary. Workbench use of tx-generator was changed to a passthru
  `noGitRev` package version to avoid redundant building of the same source because
  of differing commit hash. Release bin filtering was changed from a denyList to
  an acceptList approach to avoid inclusion creep if the denyList isn't
  maintained.
  [cardano-node-pr-6271](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6271)

* Adds cardano tracer basic startup and connect tests to hydra job
  `checks/nixosTests/cardanoNodeArtifact` and also adds cardano tracer basic
  startup and connect tests to hydra job `checks/nixosTests/cardanoNodeEdge`.
  [cardano-node-pr-6272](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6272)

* Adds cardano-tracer, tx-generator to the release bins, and cleans up the
  release bins with an allowList approach.  Hotfix backport to `10.5.1`
  [cardano-node-pr-6280](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6280)


### Cardano-signer (nix packaged)
* The [cardano-signer](https://github.com/gitmachtl/cardano-signer) upstream
  utility was nix packaged.

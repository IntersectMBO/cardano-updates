## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They worked on scaling the proof generation for `mainnet` with prototyping some optimizations and benchmarking the improvements on the performances. They also made progress in implementing low latency certification: they completed the retrieval of the tip of the chain and worked on importing transactions from Cardano mini-protocol with Pallas. Additionally, they worked on a new page of the explorer that will display in/out SPOs for the latest Cardano epochs.

Finally, the team upgraded the `testing-sanchonet` network following the `Sanchonet` network respin, worked on creating a module for building test transactions and started removing the deprecated `snapshot` command from the client CLI.

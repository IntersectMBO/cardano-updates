### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team made significant progress, implementing an offline mode with associated refactoring. They enhanced user experience by detecting incompatible eras in `hydra-node`. Protocol changes were implemented for incremental decommits, addressing off-chain logic. Additionally, the team contributed fixes to `cardano-ledger` and coordinated with the Eternl team on enabling committing into a head from their wallet.

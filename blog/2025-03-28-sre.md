## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* After upgrading hydra to new hardware and increasing eval concurrency for
better ci throughput, an upstream hydra bug caused builds to frequently block
in hydra's queue runner.  The root caused was investigated and resolved with
the fix to the [issue](https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/issues/1429) pushed
upstream.

* A sizeable chunk of effort for this biweekly was invested in cardano-node's
new tracing system, in particular between cardano-node, iohk-nix and
cardano-parts repositories. Test machines were built and deployed using the
latest tracing system changes intended for node `10.3` with comparisons between
new tracing and legacy tracing metrics made and the few remaining discrepancies
addressed by the [performance and tracing team](2025-03-28-performance-and-tracing.md#new-tracing).
New tracing system dashboards and alerts were prepared with recent changes.
Configurations in each repo were prepared for a switch to the new tracing
system as default. Readiness to migrate cardano-parts clusters to the new
tracing system is close!

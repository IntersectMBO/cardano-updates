## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept focusing on the SNARK-friendly STM library, completing the Schnorr signature scheme and the modules re-organization, and implementing some wrappers for the Jubjub backend. They also progressed on specifying the non-recursive SNARK circuit, assessing constraints on Halo2 verification keys, prototyping the recursive SNARK solution, and prototyping the Bitcoin Defi prover with RISC Zero.

Additionally, they continued implementing a simple aggregator discovery mechanism, worked on improvements to the protocol security page, and completed the enhancements of the end-to-end tests to better support the introduction of new features and the reliability of the backward compatibility test.

Finally, they worked on the second phase of the common aggregator client implementation, and kept upgrading to Cardano node v.10.6.

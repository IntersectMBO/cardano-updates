## Overview of sprints: [103][sp-103], [104][sp-104], [105][sp-105], [106][sp-106].

The most important changes are patches developed after the November fork
incident on Mainnet, which make the diffusion layer more robust.  These patches
are released in the [`cardano-node-10.5.4` release][cardano-node-10.5.4].  __We
highly recommend updating to `10.5.4`__ as these change make the Cardano
Network more robust.  We'd like to thank [Karl Knutsson][karknu] ([CF]) who
developed these patches.

This report only contains issues/PRs finished/merged in the sprints 103 through
106.  Work that has been carried and finished in the current sprint will be

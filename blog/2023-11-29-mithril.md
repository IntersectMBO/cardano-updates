## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the initial version of the [Mithril client library](https://crates.io/crates/mithril-client), enabling developers to integrate core Mithril features into their applications. They also released a new distribution, [`2347.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2347.0), which includes support for slim certificate production by the aggregator, along with bug fixes and performance improvements.

The team also introduced the initial version of Cardano/Mithril node communication enhancements,  implemented by TxPipe as part of the Catalyst project. They made progress in decentralizing Mithril networks, including testing the Mithril peer-to-peer (P2P) relay on a test network and conducting threat modeling and risk analysis for  P2P networking. Additionally, they started working on adapting the Mithril client library for WASM compilation and made progress in optimizing aggregator performance. 

Finally, they fixed inaccuracies in the verbosity level of logs across most nodes and worked on troubleshooting for some users.

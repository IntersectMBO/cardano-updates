## High level overview
The Mithril team released a new [`2321.1`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2321.1) distribution that fully implements the mechanism developed to sign generic data. They completed the upgrade of the Cardano node in the Mithril networks to v.8.0.0 and the implementation of the new computation of the stake distribution. They refactored the state machines of the signer and aggregator, and the signed entity service of the aggregator. Additionally, they worked on adapting the client and implementing a new sub-command for restoring the Cardano immutable file snapshots.

Finally, the team worked on adding a new certificate list route in the aggregator REST API, and started enhancing the infrastructure of the Mithril networks.

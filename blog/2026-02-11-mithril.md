## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team focused on implementing new succinct proofs. The team worked on pre-aggregation SNARK primitives in the STM library, completed golden master tests of the non-recursive SNARK circuit, and worked on bridging CPU and circuit implementations. They also began adapting the certificate chain for SNARK-friendliness.

Additionally, the team continued work on the new certification for Cardano blocks and transactions. This included implementing the signable builder, along with the artifact and proof routes in the aggregator REST API.

Finally, they worked on static builds for Mithril nodes and fixed bugs in the hash-to-curve implementation of the Schnorr signature.

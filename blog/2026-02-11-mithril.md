## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team focused on implementing the new succinct proofs: they worked on pre-aggregation SNARK primitives in the STM library, completed the golden master tests of the non-recursive SNARK circuit, worked on bridging the CPU and circuit implementations, and started implementing the adaptation of the certificate chain for SNARK-friendliness.

Additionally, they kept working on the new certification for Cardano blocks and transactions, implementing the signable builder, and the artifact routes and the proof routes in the aggregator REST API.

Finally, the team worked on static builds for the Mithril nodes and fixed some bugs in the hash to curve implementation of the Schnorr signature.

## High level overview

The Mithril team has started working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network with a preliminary phase which moves signer registrations to the epoch settings route of the aggregator. They also worked on optimizing the memory usage of the signer when signing the Cardano transactions. Additionnally, the team has completed the implementation of a proof-of-concept for diffusing Mithril signatures with the Cardano network layer.

Finally, they added the support for retrieving database snapshots from local files in the client, and they fixed a bug on the certification of the Cardano stake distribution.

## High level overview

The Mithril team started working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. In this preliminary phase, they are moving signer registrations to the aggregator's epoch settings route. They also optimized memory usage for signers when signing Cardano transactions and completed a proof of concept for diffusing Mithril signatures with the Cardano network layer.

Finally, they added support for retrieving database snapshots from local files in the client and fixed a bug related to the certification of Cardano stake distribution.

## Overview of [spint 102][sprint-102]

### Leios

We completed a basic prototype of a request-respond mini-protocol that supports server-side message reordering while ensuring both deadlock and livelock freedom. The prototype was reviewed by the consensus and formal methods teams. Next development steps involve simplifying the API and evaluating specific modifications tailored for Leios. At this point, we consider the technical risk of this development direction to be addressed and are transitioning to other, higher-priority Leios tasks.

### Mithril

We're moving the development to a new repository: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/dmq-node

### Ouroboros Network

* __[Optimised connectivity for peers behind firewall][#4381]__: [PR#5241][#5241] is being reviewed.
* __[Fixed ToJSON instance for DiffusionMode][#5245]__
* __[docs: fixed broken link][#5249]__: we'd like to thank [Oleksandr88] for his open-source contribution.
* __[ChainSync Timeouts][#5250]__: work in progress
* __[Enforce max reconnection attempts][#5253]__: work in progress, [Karl Knutsson][karknu] ([Cardano Foundation][CF])
* __[mux: handling trailing bytes][#5254]__
* __[PeerSelection: fixed local root test failure][#5255]__

### Cardano Node

* __[networking improvements to new tracing system][#6385]__:
  - fail in genesis mode if the peer snapshot file is older than `UseLedgerPeers` in the topology file
  - improved ledger peer snapshot warning
  - mini-protocol tracers using `Debug` severity, rather than `Info` (as in the legacy tracing system)
  - code cleanup
* __[Removed PeerT tracer][#6387]__
* __[new tracing system: networking adjustments][#6388]__:
  Made the new tracing system behave more like the old one when tracing events from the following subsystems:
  - _block-fetch_,
  - _connection manager_,
  - _refactored P2P module_.

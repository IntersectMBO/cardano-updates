## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They improved the throughput of the prover route of the aggregator by using resource pooling and made progress on low-latency certification by transitioning to a chain point-based beacon, which allows for faster transaction signing. They also kept investigating prover performance bottlenecks, worked on fixing a bug that caused unsigned transactions to appear as signed, and continued implementing the import of transactions with the ChainSync mini-protocol and Pallas.

Additionally, the team started preparing the threat modeling explainer for the documentation website and kept investigating some Cardano node error messages that could be caused by how the Pallas client handles connections to mini-protocols.

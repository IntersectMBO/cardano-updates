## High level overview

This week, some members of the Mithril team attended a wokshop on the Cardano node diversity in Paris.

They continued adapting the infrastructure to support the aggregator’s prototype ‘follower’ mode. They also focused on signing ancillary files in the Cardano database snapshots with an IOG key. Additionally, they completed implementing the recording the origin of requests made to the aggregator API.

Finally, the team kept refactoring the STM cryptographic library for improved clarity and maintainability, and started to work on the implementation of the Mithril/ALBA aggregation proof system proof-of-concept.

## Overview of [sprint 82][sprint-82]

### Extensible Ouroboros Diffusion

We merged the [**extensible diffusion**][#5016] PR.

This PR will allow us to build mithril diffusion using `ouroboros-network`, and
more generally, it makes it much easier to develop and deploy one's own
decentralised applications based on `ouroboros-network`.  This is part of
the `ouroboros-network-0.20` release, which will be included in `cardano-node-10.3`.

### Ouroboros-Network-0.20

We released `ouroboros-network-0.20` to [`CHaP`].  All released changes are
listed in [this table][on-0.20].  The most important changes are:

* [**Extensible diffusion**][#5016]
* [**Mux: bind threads to a capability**][#5069]: `cardano-node-10.3` will
  come with a new (experimental) option that will allow the bind mini-protocol
  threads to lower capabilities, leaving two capabilities free for other work.
* [**LocalTxMonitor: Add support for GetMeasures**][#4918]
* [**New start strategy for mini-protocols**][#5048]
* [**use network-3.2.7**][#5030]

### Removal of NonP2P code base

We merged [**Removal of NonP2P Network Components**][#5007] PR.  This change
will be integrated no sooner than `cardano-node-10.4`.  If you're still using
In the `NonP2P` mode, please upgrade to P2P.  Initiator-only mode for local
root peers ([#5020]) is available in the pre-release `cardano-node-10.2.1` and
future releases.  See the, to be published, [documentation
update][developer-portal#1387].

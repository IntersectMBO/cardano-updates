## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team kept implementing the fake DMQ node to facilitate end to end testing of the decentralized signature diffusion, and worked on the certificate chain synchronization in the follower aggregator. They also completed the era transition support in the clients, activated the support for Linux ARM binaries in the CI, and worked on preparing the upgrade to the Cardano node v.10.5.

Finally, they completed the upgrade of the repository for the Rust 2024 edition and progressed with refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

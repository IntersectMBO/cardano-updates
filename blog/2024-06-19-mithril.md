## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They implemented a warmup strategy for the signer and aggregator to begin importing transactions as early as possible, thus minimizing the impact of network activation on certification. They also significantly improved the throughput of the prover route of the aggregator by addressing database access bottlenecks. Additionally, the team made progress on low-latency certification by completing the handling of chain rollbacks and nearly completing the retrieval of transactions using the chain sync mini-protocol and Pallas.

Finally, they made final modifications to the threat modeling explainer for the documentation website, which will be released shortly, and worked on a bug that occurs when parsing some blocks of the SanchoNet network.

### High-level summary

The last two weeks, the Hydra team achieved several milestones. They published
the monthly report for October, providing updates on project developments. The
team delivered a presentation and workshop at the Cardano Summit, contributing
to community engagement. They implemented a \"dirt road\" solution for the
\"Ignored init tx\" notification and moved the `hydra-poll` example project to a
dedicated repository. Additionally, the team built a `hydra-chain-observer` tool
for Hydra Heads, updated the toolchain to GHC 9.6.3, and made various
improvements to tooling and code formatting. They addressed specific issues,
such as fixing the `gen-hydra-keys` command and resolving concerns with the
rewritten `hydra-tui`. The team also enhanced the `hydra-cluster` smoke test
suite by fetching network configurations dynamically. Lastly, they actively
reviewed pull requests and architectural decision records from the community,
including contributions from SundaeSwap. An experiment, the Hydra tally, was
completed and successfully deployed to the mainnet by the Cardano Foundation.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Cardano-parts environments can now be migrated from [Grafana Agent](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/)
  to [Grafana Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/).

* Most cardano-parts downstream clusters have now been migrated to grafana alloy use.


## Repository Work

### Cardano-parts
* Migrates to grafana alloy from grafana agent.  Drops deprecated
  cardano-node service features and iohk-nix legacy mainnet relay filtering.
  Fixes cardano-parts jobs for cardano-cli breaking change compatibility. More
  detail is available in the release notes:
  [cardano-parts-release-v2024-10-22](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts/releases/tag/v2024-10-22)

### Cardano-playground
* Migrates to grafana alloy for metrics collection, rotates sanchonet kes,
  fixes latest govtool develop nix packaging and nginx deployment and deploys
  to sanchonet.  More detail is available in the PR description:
  [cardano-playground-pull-34](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-playground/pull/34)

### Cardano-mainnet
* Migrates to grafana alloy for metrics collection, fixes scheduled restart
  service status file.  More detail is available in the PR description:
  [cardano-mainnet-pull-24](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-mainnet/pull/24)

### Cardano-node
* Removes legacy mainnet relay filter for bootstrap attr generation, bumps the
  iohkNix pin for similarly updated topology generation, updates mainnet
  topology config to match updated iohk-nix topology ordering.
  [cardano-node-pull-6011](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6011)

### Govtool
* Fixes nix builds for frontend and backend components, required node_nixpkgs
  pin update and regeneration of yarn.lock. Fixes impure nix builds required by
  some deployers by adding an optional returnShellEnv bool to the backend
  package.
  [govtool-pull-2184](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/pull/2184)

### Iohk-nix

  edgeNodes in alphabetical order.

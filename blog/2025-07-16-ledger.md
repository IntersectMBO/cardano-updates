## High level summary

This period we continued with tackling tech debt, implementing improvements that are necessary for
the next Dijkstra era and we prepared the Dijkstra era for proper integration into all other
components.  Besides this we made various improvements to the `constrained-generation` library and
prepared it for an initial release.

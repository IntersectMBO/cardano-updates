## High level summary

- Supported debugging activities related to bootstrap nodes.
- Merged various improvements to the `db-X` tools; in particular, `db-truncater` (which is used regularly by community members on sanchonet) [got much faster](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/pull/1143).

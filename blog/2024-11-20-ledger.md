## High level summary

The most notable change this period is extraction of a testing framework [`ImpSpec`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ImpSpec) that we developed for testing Ledger implementation. This meant extracting reusable functionality, packaging into a seperate library and [releasing it to Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ImpSpec).

Most of the efforts are still dedicated to improving our tests and working on conformance testing.

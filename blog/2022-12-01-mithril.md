## High level overview
The Mithril team worked on finalizing their release process by adding new features: publishing their cryptographic library to the Rust community, adding node versions manifest in the release notes, and signing the binaries embedded in the distributions. They deprecated the declarative signer node registration that will be decommissioned in a few weeks. The team also completed the automatic store upgrade process for the signer and aggregator nodes. 

Finally, the team continued working on the redaction of the CIP that will allow the decentralization of Mithril by using the Cardano networking layer.

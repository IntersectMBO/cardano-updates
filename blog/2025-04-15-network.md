## Overview of [sprint 85][sprint-85]

### High-level overview

#### Node Diversity Workshop

  We participated in the Node Diversity workshop held in Paris by Tweag / Modus
  Create.  We had a chance to talk with [amaru] and [goroboros] developers.

  We were in particular interested in testing approach for the [amaru] node,
  which is described in a recent [series of blog posts][stavena].

#### Tx-Submission

We continued working on `tx-submission`.  We're analysing a test failure which prevents us from merging the PR.

#### Mithril

Armando Santos (Well-Typed) open a draft PR in which he's been working on
implementation of the DMQ Node, see [ouroboros-network#5109]. Armando also
wrote an update to the [CIP#137] proposal.

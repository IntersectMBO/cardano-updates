## High level overview

This year, the Mithril team continues to prioritize protocol decentralization through the DMQ network, broader protocol adoption, and the introduction of succinct proofs by evolving the STM library with SNARKs.

This week, the Mithril team prepared the pre-release for the `2603.1-pre` distribution. This version introduces support for the DMQ protocol, preliminary support for decentralized configuration, implementation of the Blockfrost API to fetch stake pool operators' pool tickers and names, and various bug fixes and improvements.

The team focused on implementing the SNARK-friendly STM library, kept developing the non-recursive SNARK circuit MVP within it, and kept working on the pre-aggregation SNARK primitives. They also kept working on the prototype of the recursive SNARK circuit.

Additionally, they worked on the new certification for Cardano blocks and transactions with the implementation of the storage layer, the artifact builder and the preloader with throttling.

Finally, they worked on documenting proposals to integrate Mithril and DMQ nodes with Cardano, and continued updating the protocol security page.

## High level summary

In last sprint the team focused on preparations for the conference talk at
[OPODIS 2022].  We also worked on preparations to publish `io-sim` and related
packages on Hackage ([PR #57], [PR #60]).

We also started reviewing:
* `ouroboros-network`
* `cardano-node`
* `cardano-ledger`
repositories for open-source readiness ([PR #4128]).

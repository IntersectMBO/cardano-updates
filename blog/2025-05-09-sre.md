## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Cardano-node and cardano-cli pre-release versions are now set to `10.4.1` and
`10.8.0.0`, respectively, in cardano-parts release `v2025-05-01`.

* In cardano-node, support for GHC `8.10` has been removed in master reducing
CI eval times to < ~3 min.  The next tagged pre-release or release after node
`10.4.1` will support only GHC `9.6`.


## Repository Work -- Merged

### Cardano-parts
* Sets node pre-release to `10.4.1`, cardano-cli pre-release to `10.8.0.0`.
  [cardano-parts-release-v2025-05-01](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts/releases/tag/v2025-05-01)


### Cardano-node
* Auto ghcr latest tagging currently occurs on full releases. Promotion of
  pre-release to release, however, doesn't trigger a published event, and instead
  requires a manual workflow dispatch off the newly promoted release tag. This PR
  adds ghcr latest tagging to the manual workflow dispatch pre-release to release
  use case.
  [cardano-node-pr-6200](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6200)

* Drops support for haskellNix ghc `8.10.x` which also reduces eval time to ~3 min
  with the removal of 249 variant packages.
  [cardano-node-pr-6206](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6206)

* Removes the eventlogged package as ghc >= `9.4` includes unconditional -eventlog support in RTS.
  [cardano-node-pr-6208](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6208)


### Cardano-playground
* Sets node pre-release to `10.4.1` and cardano-cli pre-release to `10.8.0.0` with
  cardano-parts release `v2025-05-01`. Updates and deploys cardano-book
  configuration for node pre-release `10.4.1`. Adds `preview1-test-a-1` machine,
  sops updates and secrets for test forging across legacy and new tracing.

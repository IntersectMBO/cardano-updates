## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued working on a prototype 'slave' mode of the aggregator to support signer registration across multiple aggregators. They also focused on implementing incremental certification of the Cardano database, emphasizing feature stabilization, production readiness, testing, and optimization. Additionally, they worked on signing ancillary files in the Cardano database snapshots with an IOG key.

Finally, the team fixed failing builds in the Hydra CI and kept working on supporting the upcoming Cardano node v.10.2.

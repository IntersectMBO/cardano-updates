### High-level summary

This week we merged incremental decommits, and got the latest Hydra Head
running, on preview, between the team. We also provided a new NixOs
configuration for running a Hydra node. We will be working on incremental
commits, followsup to the incremental decommit work, and improvements/tests
for our network reliability next.


### What did the team achieve?

* Incremental decommit merged! [#1344](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1344)
* Incremental decommit in the TUI [#1518](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1518)
* Hydra Head, and [Hydraw](http://hydraw.hydra.family/), up and running on preview network
* New NixOS-based setup for a Hydra Head node [#1506](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1506)


### What's next?

* Continued work on incremental commit: Off-chain journey
* Network reliability investigations
* Small followups to incremental decommit work
* Support Hydra demo at Rare Evo
* Have a Head open on `preview` to see it working through the upcoming hard fork

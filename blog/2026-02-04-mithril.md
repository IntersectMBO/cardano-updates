## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the `2603.1` distribution. This version introduces support for the DMQ protocol, preliminary support for decentralized configuration, implementation of the Blockfrost API to fetch stake pool operators' pool tickers and names, and various bug fixes and improvements.

The team focused on implementing the pre-aggregation SNARK primitives in the STM library and progressed work on the non-recursive SNARK circuit MVP with golden tests.

Additionally, they kept working on the new certification for Cardano blocks and transactions, implementing the signable builder, and artifact routes in the aggregator REST API. They also completed documenting proposals for increasing adoption of Mithril and DMQ nodes in Cardano.

Finally, they fixed some bugs in the DMQ publisher and the follower aggregator, and they kept updating the protocol security page.

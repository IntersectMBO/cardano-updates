## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the new distribution [`2517.1`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2517.1), which fixes a client security issue discussed in this [developer blog post](https://mithril.network/doc/dev-blog/2025/05/07/client-security-advisory). This version supports Cardano node v.10.3.1 and allows for signing ancillary files in the Cardano database snapshots using an IOG key. It also includes various bug fixes and improvements.

The team continued progressing on the DMQ node implementation by adjusting the cadencing of the signer and aggregator state machines and developing the delayer and retrier decorators to support multiple signature publishers in the signer.

Finally, the team worked on fixing some bugs in the infrastructure, and kept refactoring the STM cryptographic library for improved clarity.

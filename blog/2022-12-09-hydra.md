## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team has worked on completing to "Validate coordinated head protocol against formal model", this is a huge step to verify the implementation is secure. They also worked on implementing [ADR21](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/7e532bd1c8a840a8155cf4b0858b982308dfc3f0/docs/adr/CloseTx-validity-bounds-and-deadline-calculation-DoS.md) related to bounded tx validity which is now under review. [HydraPay](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay) project, from Obsidian Systems, is coming to an end of the first phase at least, so team did a review and submitted couple of [issues](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay/issues?q=is%3Aissue) they found in the process. The team had a meeting with the Director of CyberSecurity - topic was the RFP that is currently in flight that should scope the work of future auditors. Also, the team completed the hydra-tutorial review created by our colleague Thomas Vellecoop from the education team, and we are close to integrate it to our official site. From the development side, they have fixed a bug on the CI when running the benchmark jobs to calculate the cost of abortTx and a flaky spec which checks a plutus merkle-tree is always balanced.

## What did the team achieve this week

- Document model based testing [#194](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/194) & [#641](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/641)
- Got [ADR21](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/7e532bd1c8a840a8155cf4b0858b982308dfc3f0/docs/adr/CloseTx-validity-bounds-and-deadline-calculation-DoS.md) under review.
- Complete review on `hydra-tutorial`.
- Complete first round of review on `HydraPay` work [#634](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/634)
- Meeting with `Director of CyberSecurity` frio `IOG` to unblock "the RFP prepared for the external audit" [#606](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/606)
- Remove `vasil-dev` and `testnet` from `smoke-test` because they were not working [#630](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/630)
- Fix flaky `plutus-merkle-tree` test [#642](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/642)
- Refactor `NetworkSpec` to improve legilibility.
- Fix benchmark cost for `abortTx` [#631](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/631)
- Adapt `nix.conf` to the recent hydra-ci nix cache migration.

## What are the goals of next week

- Get [ADR21](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/7e532bd1c8a840a8155cf4b0858b982308dfc3f0/docs/adr/CloseTx-validity-bounds-and-deadline-calculation-DoS.md) accepted & close tx validity gap in our implementation.
- Integrate the `hydra-tutorial`.
- Have a LaTeX write-up of the HeadV1 (Coordinated Hydra Head) spec.
- Get Cicero (new CI) working.
- Use reference inputs to reduce the cost of the `commitTx`.

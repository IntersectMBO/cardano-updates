## Network Update

### Key contributions

We held a series of session to review the implementation of big ledger peers
(eclipse evasion). See [#4462].

We get a request from a 3rd party to clarify an inconsistency between CDDL spec
and protocol implementation.  We worked out a nice solution which takes
advantage of the `any` notion available in `CDDL`.  On the Haskell side we
provide `Any` type which gen generate almost any CBOR term (some are excluded
only because they are not decoded back to the same form, and we relay on that
property).  See [#4580].

We fixed a bunch of problems of the `cardano-cli ping` command.  It also now has
a limited support of `node-to-client` mini-protocol (the `-c` option is
ignored, as it cannot be supported by `node-to-client` protocol).  Note that
the format of messages has changed, timestamps are printed in ISO8601 format.
See [#4601], [#5326], [#5313], [#30]

In order to provide a new flag in the topology file which enables ledger peers
when the chain is close to the tip, we continued to work on [#4530].  This is
currently in review, the consensus team will need to provide us with the new
api.  This feature is useful for two reasons: makes it easier to maintain
a topology file, it will also limit the traffic on public roots generated by
for example full node wallets and distribute it to ledger peers.

We also continued to work on a blog post which describes the journey of design
& implementation of the dynamic P2P network layer.  Too be announced soon :).  

### Other smaller changes

We limit the concurrency of resolving dns names.  Up to 8 root peers or ledger
peers DNS names are resolved concurrently, and at most 2 local root peer DNS
names. See [#4596].

We fixed handshake query timeout in [#4603].

We renamed one of the block-fetch decision constructors as requested by the
consensus team, see [#4608].

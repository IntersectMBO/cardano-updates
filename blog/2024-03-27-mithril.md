## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released a new [`Mithril distribution 2412.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2412.0). This release includes several critical updates and enhancements, such as support for the Prometheus metrics endpoint in signer, deprecation of the `snapshot` command in the client CLI, full Pallas-based implementation of the chain observer, and support for Cardano node v.8.9.0. 

The team continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They focused on scaling the signature and proof generation for `mainnet`, kept implementing a more versatile beaconing mechanism, reducing the latency of transactions signature, and continued investigating a bug in the block parser that prevents some Conway transactions from being signed. Additionally, they started working on a prototype to decentralize signer registration with the relay and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

Finally, the team completed the implementation of some community-requested features to verify the output folder structure made by the client, and kept investigating a source of flakiness in the CI end-to-end test.

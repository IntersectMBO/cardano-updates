## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released a new [**Mithril protocol insights dashboard**](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8b05ea4b-6a43-45ea-aef2-237906ec7a42/page/kem0D?s=oi6CR5eZrnQ) and a new explorer page displaying active and deregistered SPOs for the latest Cardano epochs. They also continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks by improving the throughput of the prover route of the aggregator and making progress on low-latency certification by completing the implementation of a chain block reader from the Cardano mini-protocol with Pallas.

Additionally, the team started working on a new beacon for signing Cardano transactions based on the chain point. Finally, they refactored the persistence library, enhanced their testing tools for Cardano transactions, and fixed a block parsing problem that prevented the signature of Cardano transactions in the test networks.

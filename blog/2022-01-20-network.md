## High level summary

We have been working towards `cardano-node-1.35.5` release.  QA & benchmarking
teams gave a green light for the release, and we made decent progress with some
CI problem which we encountered on the way ([PR #4612]). We are also working on
peer sharing, making improvements in our testing infrastructure, reducing
technical debt and making progress towards `io-sim-1.0.0.0`. Galois is making
progress on Handshake improvements.

## Low level summary

Our diffusion simulation network now includes a mixed network of `initiator
only` and `initiator and responder` nodes. [issue #4222]

We are now reviewing the [peer sharing pull request][PR #4019].

We are also reviewing pull request which introduces handshake query flag. [PR #4256]

We fixed a bug in our network simulator.  The bug was triggered when a node
died when performing a simultaneous TCP open (a corner case of a corner case!). [PR #4265]

We also refactored `Snocket` interface and removed the bearer construction from
its methods. [PR #4260]

We are working towards releasing `io-sim-1.0.0.0` on Hackage, which includes
reviewing two PRs: [PR #57] and [PR #60] as well as writing an announcement
blog post.

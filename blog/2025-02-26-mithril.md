## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing incremental certification of the Cardano database, focusing on feature stabilization and production readiness. They also worked on supporting the upcoming Cardano node v.10.2 and documenting the certification process for each certifiable data type.

Finally, the team completed cleaning up legacy code from the 'Thales' era and started working on a slave mode for the aggregator signer registration.

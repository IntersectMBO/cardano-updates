## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing incremental certification of the Cardano database: they kept stabilizing features and preparing for production readiness. They worked on supporting the upcoming Cardano node v10.2. Additionally, they worked on thoroughly documenting the certification process for each type of data which can be certified by Mithril.

Finally, the team completed cleaning up legacy code from the 'Thales' era, and they started to work on a slave mode for the aggregator signer registration.

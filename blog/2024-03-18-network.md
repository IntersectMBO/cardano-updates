## High-level overview of [sprint 57][sprint-57]

We released [`cardano-node-8.9.0`] \(which includes
`ouroboros-newtork-0.12.0.0`).  This release contains the following network
upgrades:

* bootstrap peers (aka _Light Genesis_): [ouroboros-network#4555],
  [ouroboros-network#4799], [ouroboros-network#4810]; 
* churn changes: [ouroboros-newtork#4800];
* peer sharing changes: [ouroboros-network#4778], [ouroboros-network#4788], [ouroboros-network#4793];
* code refactoring & documentation fixes.

Soon we will release [`cardano-node-8.9.1`] \(which includes
`ouroboros-network-0.12.0.0`).  This release will contain:

* Peer sharing improvements & fixes. Contributed and tested by Karl Knutsson [CF].
* `cardano-ping` updates to support `NodeToNode_V13` & peer sharing.
* Some smaller maintenance changes.

The list of network features included in `ouroboros-network-0.12.0.0` and
`ouroboros-network-0.13.0.0` can be found [here][ouroboros-network-releases].

We also continued working on `tx-submission`, [ouroboros-network#3311].  Mostly
working on the pure internal API for decision-making and testing it with
property-based tests.  The next step is to get all the information needed to run
the decision logic in an efficient way and later write a mini-protocol client
which is using the new API and testing it.

We also started working on thing to finalise the Genesis support from the
network.  We have a PR under review, [ouroboros-network#4832].  We also started
to investigate how to support big ledger peer snapshots.  This requires changes
in the topology file as well as `cardano-node` & `ouroboros-network` to
understand the snapshots; and on the other hand creation of such snapshots by
`cardano-cli`.

## Low-level summary

This time everything was _high-level_, :wink:.

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team successfully integrated the Haskell DMQ node with Mithril nodes in the end-to-end tests. They continued to implement the first phase of decentralizing the configuration parameters. They also worked on some enhancements to the client library and CLI to provide access to Cardano database incremental snapshots by epoch. Additionally, they updated the signer to ensure it has a unique protocol initializer for each epoch.

Finally, the team fixed some bugs in the CI and completed the first refactoring of the STM cryptographic library that enhances its readability.

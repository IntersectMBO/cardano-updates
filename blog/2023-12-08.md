This week, the Hydra team made progress by releasing version
[0.14.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases/tag/0.14.0),

in preparation for Conway support, addressing
[\#1114](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1114).
Additionally, the team completed substantial refactoring in hydra-node
using stateless observation, aiming to enhance system efficiency and

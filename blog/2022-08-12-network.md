The networking team took an active part in the project iteration (PI) planning
session, see cardano-node [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/39) for detailed
outcomes.


* We started working on a detailed design / implementation plan for gossip.

* We merged [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3859](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3859) which
  sets the ouroboros-network repository for the single relay release.

* We identified a bug in the network simulator, which is fixed in the
  [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3852](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3852).
  The above PR was reviewed.

* We set the tracing configuration for nodes which we deploy and fixed and
  identified some deployment hiccups.  We identified some bugs in the RT view
  which were registered by the maintainers.
  [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network-ops#4](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network-ops/pull/4)

* We fixed typos in network-mux library:
  [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3921](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3921)

* For easy of debugging we renamed a trace point:
  [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3922](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3922)

* Duncan iterated on his simulation / visualisation.  He also was able to
  identify and fix a bug in the simulator.  The simulation contains 50 nodes.
  Dashed lines indicate and established connection, while solid lines indicate
  a TCP connection with fully open TCP window.

### High-level summary

The team has been working hard on some bugfixes and investigations, as well as
a new feature that can be used to "un-stuck" a Hydra head: side-loading
snapshots. We're working on some documentation of this feature, and in the
coming weeks we will merge several bugfixes, and an implementation of the
"Withdraw 0" trick, which will turn out to be very convenient for those
wishing to use custom plutus operations on the L2 ledger but still retain the
ability to fanout.

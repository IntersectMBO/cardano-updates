## High level overview

The Mithril team continued working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. They kept implementing a buffer store for individual signatures that may arrive before being processed by an aggregator, kept working on refactoring the state machine of the signer, and started working on a mechanism to support specific configurations for signing the Cardano transactions. Additionally, they fixed the panics occurring in both the signer and aggregator during rollbacks of the Cardano chain.

Finally, the team continued preparing the next distribution and investigated a problem that prevents the consistent certification of the Cardano transactions in the `pre-release-preview` network.

## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team has put their effort on finding solutions on many different problems, such as our broken head on mainnet [#897](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/897), our fragile monthly report publications on the website and implementing &ldquo;Option A&rdquo; for external commits [#215](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/215). Although most of these items are still open, huge progress has been made. To accelerate the investigation, they improved their logging to give more precise errors when a transition requirement fails, and to reduce duplication on effets logged content.
Also, worth to mention that they started interviewing candidates to join our team.
Last but not least, we want to give a big up to @Sebastian for being invited and attending a workshop on formal methods and crypto in Agda!


## What did the team achieve this week

-   Continued investigating broken head and opened an issue to keep track [#897](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/897).
    
    As part of this issue, improvements were made to the node logs:

    +   Give a precise error when a transition requirement fails [#895](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/895).

    +   Reduce duplication for effects logged content by using sequential eventId and effectId pair  [#896](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/896).

-   Completed external commits with script UTxOs [#215](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/215).
    
    Have a first end-to-end journey for external commits implementing &ldquo;Option A&rdquo;
    for script UTxOs [#903](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/903) (still considering &ldquo;Option B&rdquo;).

-   Interviews for opening to join the team.

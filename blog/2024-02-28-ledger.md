## High level summary

Quite a useful and desired feature described in
[CIP-0110](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/679) of allowing reference
scripts for PlutusV1 has been implemented for Conway.

For the most part we are now spending time on writing tests and enhancing out tooling that
we use for testing. This is paying out dividends since we are finding and fixing important
Conway related bugs. Notable bugs that were squashed this time around are related to using
incorrect stake distribution for both DReps and Stake Pools.

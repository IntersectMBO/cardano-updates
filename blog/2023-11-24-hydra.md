### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team spent significant time opening a head among
themselves on `mainnet` using the release candidate, revealing and
addressing lurking bugs such as
[\#1174](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1174). Also
required was this change to dynamically calculate the min utxo value
[\#1176](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1176), a
necessary adjustment following the switch to inline datums. The team
engaged with `cardano-cli` / `cardano-api` maintainers to discuss recent
changes and collaborated on drafting feature ideas, including providing
[Conway support](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1177)
for the Hydra roadmap. As part of ongoing improvements, they
experimented with writing the specification in markdown instead of
LaTex.

### What did the team achieve this week

- Opened head among us on mainnet and uncovered a few lurking bugs like
  [\#1174](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1174) in the
  release candidate
- Calculate the min utxo value instead of hard-coding it
  [\#1176](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1176), which is
  needed since we switched to inline datums.
- Met with the `cardano-cli` / `cardano-api` maintainers to discuss
  recent changes and way forward
- Drafted features ideas to provide [Conway
  support](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1177) on the
  Hydra roadmap
- Experimented in writing the specification in markdown instead of LaTex

### What are the goals of next week

- Have the Monthly review meeting with several demos
- Release version 0.14.0 with [this
  scope](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/milestone/14?closed=1)
- Complete tidying up chain layer via stateless observation changes in
  hydra-node
  [\#1096](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1096)
- Update dependencies to prepare for Conway
  [\#1114](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1114)

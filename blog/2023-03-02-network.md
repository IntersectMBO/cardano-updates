## High level summary

In the current sprint the networking team focused on fixing bugs and pushing
forward implementation of eclipse evasion.  We also found a bug in our
simulation testing setup (in integration of test node).  We also overviewed the
work on extending handshake protocol which is delivered by Galois Inc.

We published `ouroboros-netork-0.4.0.1` and
`ouroboros-network-protocols-0.3.0.0` to [CHaP][PR #147].

We also fixed a bug in `cardano-node` which results in not being able to
configure inbound connection limits, see [PR #4902].

Together with Karl Knutsson (CF) we realised an issue in `cardano-cli`: it's
validation of DNS names, IP address & ports when registering a stake pool
should be more strict to protect against common mistakes which we identified on
the chain.  See [issue #4929].

## Detailed work log

In [PR #4385] we fixed two bugs in peer state actions.  First one results in
a busy loop if demotion from hot to warm times outs.  This busy loop is
eventually exited when mux exits (we reported this in our previous report).
This fix made it to `1.35.6` release as well.

In addition the [PR #4385] also fixes another bug which results in `hot -> warm
-> hot` demotion / promotion busy loop.

The [PR #4385] also fixed a bug in a node only used in simulation which
resulted in not using `chain-sync` or `block-fetch` mini-protocols.  In the
review process, we realised that the header-body split in the simulated node
requires further work (see [PR #4419], which is under review).

The [PR #4385] also extend our generators, which together with the above fix,
cover the `hot -> warm -> hot` demotion / promotion busy loop.

In [PR #4419] we introduce a `ChainDB` for our simulation node, which plays
similar role to `ChainDB` in the `ouroboros-consensus`: a persistent (across
simulated restarts) store of blocks which does chain selection.  This ensures
that the simulated node is using `block-fetch` to download blocks announced by
`chain-sync` mini-protocol.

We also made progress with reviewing [PR #4019] - peer sharing.

We also fixed [issue #4370] - a connection manager test failure, see [PR #4384].

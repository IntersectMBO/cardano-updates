## High level overview
The Mithril team released a new [`2315.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2315.0) distribution that implements the first part of the migration of the aggregator stores along with minor improvements and bug fixes. They finished the migration of the aggregator stores to a relational design by completing the adaptation and migration of the signed entity, signer and single signature stores. They also created a new tick service that provides beacons to other services of the aggregator. Additionally, they started implementing the new new certifier service of the aggregator that is in charge of producing certificates for multi-signatures.

Finally, they completed the design and definition of the interfaces that must be implemented to provide certification for a new type of data in a Mithril network.

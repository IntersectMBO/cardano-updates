## High level summary
During the last 2 weeks we did more improvements on our Test Framework, ran some sanity tests related to the _P2P Single
Relay_ functionality.

We also update the Node & DB-Sync sync tets to build with Nix as the prebuilt files are no longer available at PR level.

## Workstreams

### Framework improvements:
- extended the _cardano-node-tests_ with the ability for anybody to fork the repo and [run all our System Tests on GitHub Actions](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node-tests/readme.html)
- added 2 new nightly pipelines - nightly-mixed and nightly-p2p - [details here](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node-tests/test_results/nightly_system_tests.html)
- some optimizations on how our regression tests are scheduled on pytest workers and how cluster instances are assigned to the tests;

`  === 743 passed, 67 skipped, 24 xfailed in 9166.64s (2:32:46) ===
  to
  === 753 passed, 67 skipped, 14 xfailed in 4654.80s (1:17:34) ===`

### Node:
- ran a couple of sanity runs of CLI a& sync tests on a local branch with P2P Single Relay enabled

### High-level Summary

This week the Hydra team, in addition to the usual maintenance and bug fixing, has been working on the preparation for the switch to Conway making the codebase less babbage specific. The team also conducted the monthly review meeting and published the monthly report on a new website (to keep those reports separate of main repository). They also added a basic UI to the Hydra explorer, switched to aggregating `sanchonet` data and also fixed the smoke tests to work on `sanchonet`. Finally, they continued progress the off-chain incremental commit protocol changes.

# What did the team achieve this week

- Conducted the monthly review meeting, written and published the [monthly report](https://cardano-scaling.github.io/website/monthly/2024-02) on new website (just pushed to <https://cardano-scaling.org>).
- Added a basic UI to the [Hydra explorer](http://explorer.hydra.family) in [\#1331](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1330) and switched to displaying `sanchonet` data.
- Fixed sanchonet smoke tests [\#1323](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1323), see Github [Actions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/actions/workflows/smoke-test.yaml).
- Refactored and simplified the nix flake [\#1317](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1317).
- Updated to cardano-api-8.39 [\#1316](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1316).
- Prepare future switch to Conway by making hydra-cardano-api less babbage specific in [\#1326](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1326), [\#1327](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1327) and [\#1328](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1328).

### What are the goals of next week

- Complete preparation for [\#1178](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1178) to switch to Conway (by "flipping" a switch)
- Complete off-chain incremental commit protocol changes [\#199](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/199) (and focus on the on-chain part after).
- Re-align with SundaeLabs on `EventSource` and `EventSink` refactoring.

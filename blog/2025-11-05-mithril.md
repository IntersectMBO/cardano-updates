## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team released the `2543.0` distribution, which introduces support for the default incremental backend (v2) for Cardano database restoration, enhanced integrity verification that reports any tampered or missing files in case of failure, and various bug fixes and improvements.

The team also kept implementing a simple aggregator discovery mechanism and continued work on the first phase of decentralizing configuration parameters. Additionally, they progressed on the implementation of the SNARK-friendly STM library with the design of the architecture of the library and the implementation of the Schnorr signature scheme.

Finally, they completed the implementation of a common HTTP client for the aggregator and worked on the enhancement of the protocol security page.

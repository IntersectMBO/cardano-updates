### High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team identified and resolved issues with a malfunctioning
head on mainnet, implementing preventive measures. They edited and merged a new
Architectural Decision Record (ADR) proposed by SundaeLabs, upgraded
cardano-node to version 8.7.2, and improved the TUI user experience.
Preparations for "Conway support" were initiated, and updates were made to logs
and API schemas. Additionally, initial steps were taken towards incremental
decommits.

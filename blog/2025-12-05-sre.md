## High level summary

The SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.

Some notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:

* Within approximately 1 day of the preview network partition occurring,
mentioned in the last biweekly SRE update, mainnet experienced a similar
partition.  Again, after an intense multi-team and community collaborative
effort which the SRE team was participating in from the beginning, a new
cardano-node version `10.5.3` was released to fix the issue, with all network
participants on problematic versions encouraged to upgrade immediately so that
the partition would resolve itself as the majority of stake aligned under node
versions with proper ledger hash handling.  Indeed, with the quick reaction of
the community as a whole, the network partition resolved within approximately
14 hours.  Various after action reports are available detailing the event, such
as Pi Lanningham's [Poison Piggy - After Action Report](https://www.314pool.com/post/cardano-post-mortem-2)

* Subsequent to the mainnet fork event above, `10.6.1` has also been
pre-released and deployed to IOE pre-release infrastructure.  The SRE team has
also been participating in other after action investigation activity.

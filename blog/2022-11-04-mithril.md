# High level overview
This sprint, the team has been working on the new continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and the automated deployment of environments as part of the new version of the release process. They also coordinated the migration of the pioneer SPO nodes to these new Mithril networks. They have been implementing the automatic data storage upgrade of the signer and the aggregator nodes. Finally, on the crypto side of things, we've implemented an efficiency improvement on the size of the mithril certificates.
# Low level overview
- We have been moving forward on the implementation of the release process [#500](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/500):
  - Setup of the new hosted environments for `testing-preview`, `pre-release-preview` and `release-preprod` with their terraform and GitHub environments [#542](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/542)

## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing the certification of Cardano transactions in Mithril networks. They completed the low-latency certification with the retrieval of transactions using the chain sync mini-protocol and Pallas, and they worked on fixing some bugs occuring during the warmup phase of the signer and aggregator. They also worked on supporting the new Cardano node version `8.12`. Additionally, the team kept redacting a draft CIP for the diffusion of Mithril signatures through the Cardano network.

Finally, they fixed a bug that prevented the parsing of some blocks in the SanchoNet network and made some optimizations on the databases of the signer and aggregator.

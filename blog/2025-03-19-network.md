## Overview of [sprint 83][sprint-83]

### High-level overview

#### SRV support (Cardano, Mithril)

We merged [ouroboros-network#5018] which adds support for SRV in `ouroboros-network`.
However, we still need to make a decision whether we require that all Cardano
SRVs start with `_cardano._tcp`, or we leave it open for the future.  The
former would allow us to use `SRV`s for different applications, e.g.
`_mithril._tcp` for the mithril diffusion.  If that would be the case then we'd
prepend `_cardano._tcp` to what we find in the SRV field of a registration
certificate, e.g. prepend `_cardano._tcp` by `cardano-node`'s diffusion, and
`_mithril._tcp` by the mithril diffusion.  The other possibility is to extend
the registration certificate to include the addresses of mithril nodes.

#### Mithril

We started working on a development plan for Mithril diffusion,
[ref][mithirl-diffusion] (note that this is a work in progress).

We also have been working on moving network-related code from the
`cardano-node` to the `cardano-diffusion` library in `ouroboros-network`.  In the
future, this will allow us to share parts of it in the Mithril diffusion [ouroboros-newtork#5082].

#### Documentation

We improved our CDDL specifications by annotating which codecs require definite
/ in-definite encoding of lists & maps, see [ouroboros-network#5089].

#### Mux

Karl Knutsson ([CF]) has been working on performance improvements in the
multiplexer (`network-mux` library), [ouroboros-network#5093].

#### Server-side performance considerations

Karl Kntusson ([CF]) noticed a performance bottleneck in the responder
(server) side of the p2p diffusion layer.  We've started working on addressing
this issue.

#### Tx-Submission logic

We continued reviewing/improving the `tx-submission` PR [ouroboros-network#4887].

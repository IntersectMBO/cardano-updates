## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team completed the certificate chain synchronization in the follower aggregator. They continued implementing the mock DMQ node to support end-to-end testing of decentralized signature diffusion. They also worked on enhancing the 'verify' command on the client CLI to provide a detailed list of invalid or missing immutable files. Additionally, they kept preparing for the upgrade to Cardano node v.10.5 and the upcoming Mithril distribution.

Finally, they worked on refactoring the 'CardanoNetwork' entity, enhancing the maintainability of the new website, and made progress refactoring the STM cryptographic library.

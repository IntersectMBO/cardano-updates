## High level summary

Ledger team has successfully defined what sub-transaction really means for Nested Transactions in Dijkstra era. We've also reduced quite a bit of duplication with respect to how CDDL is specified with further improvements that are still in progress. We have fixed some serialization issues for Dijkstra era that we couldn't fix for previous eras, which had to do with preventing duplicates being supplied over the wire. Besides these improvements we've also cleaned up some deprecated functionality, reduced memory overhead in ledger state, improved performance of the epoch boundary transition and fixed some issues in conformance tests.

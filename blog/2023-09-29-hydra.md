## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team mainly focused on having a working new reliability
network layer; and specified its expected behavior in a new ADR.

They also revisited the security policy and vulnerability disclosure policy on
how to handle security vulnerability within Hydra, and in particular how to
handle so-called "Silent fixes".

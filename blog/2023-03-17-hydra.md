## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team has continued work on the mainnet compatibility of the
hydra-node. They added a golden test suite for `hydra-plutus` scripts, added
some detection of `hydra-node` misconfiguration, established a limit of 100 ADA
per commit and other smaller tasks to prepare for a mainnet beta release.

Next week there will be a small team workshop to push for demonstrating a Hydra
Head on the Cardano mainnet, ideally just in time for the monthly review
meeting. See the hydra channels on the IOG Technical Community discord server
for details.

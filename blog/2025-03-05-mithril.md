## High level overview

This week, the Mithril team continued implementing incremental certification of the Cardano database, focusing on feature stabilization, production readiness, testing, and optimization. They also worked on implementing a prototype 'slave' mode of the aggregator to support the signer registration across multiple aggregators. Additionally, they kept working on supporting the upcoming Cardano node v.10.2.

Finally, the team continued investigating the source of failing builds in the Hydra CI and worked on setting up code ADRs in the repository.

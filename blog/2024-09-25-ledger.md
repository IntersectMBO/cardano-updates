## High level summary

Aside from more testing and overall quality-of-life improvements on the ledger test suite
side, we have implemented a couple of important features that will be enabled after the
next intra-era hard fork:

* Translation of `RegTxCert` and `UnRegTxCert` to `PlutusV3` scripts context will now be
  done correctly, which means deposit and refund respectively, will actually be translated.
* Treasury withdrawals that are empty or sum up to zero will no longer be allowed.

Some performance improvements and a bug fix to a ledger event were also implemented during this period.

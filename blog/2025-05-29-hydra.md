### High-level summary

We are excited to be making great progress towards a "light-weight" Hydra node
by finishing the Blockfrost chain-following integration. We have also made
great progress on our fixes around deposits. We have made some other small UX
improvements and continue focusing in that area, as well as continuing our
focus of supporting the Midnight Glacier Drop. We will largely continue on as
we have been; making UX improvements and finishing the final bits and pieces
for the deposit checks.

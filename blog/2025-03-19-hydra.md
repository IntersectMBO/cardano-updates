### High-level summary

The team is very excited to have relased the work on reducing the memory
footprint of the Hydra node by merging
[#1618](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1618). This has been
tested and appears to make a huge impact to long-running Hydra nodes with many
transactions. We invite the community to test it more! We also made a couple
of hotfixes and documentation improvements.

### What did the team achieve?

* Merged work on reduced memory footprint for running a Hydra Node [#1618](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1618)
* Progress on "side-load" of a snapshot [#1858](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1858)
* Updated documentation for persistence cleaning [#1899](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1899)
* Fixed a bug where the TUI wasn't getting enough history [#1901](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1901)
* Allowed for `etcd` arguments to be passed on [#1891](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1891); useful for controlling etcd more explicitly.
* Added `/snapshot/last-seen` endpoint to query the latest snapshot [#1886](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1886)

### What's next?

* Finish side-loading snapshots [#1858](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1858)
* Tighten security options of the networking layer [#1867](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1867)
* Publishing scripts with blockfrost [#1668](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1668)

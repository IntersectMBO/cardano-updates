The format is meant to increase transparency and\\nprovide insight into those measurements that accompany mainnet releases - demonstrating the absence of performance regressions and development\\nof specific metrics over time.\\n\\n#### Conway benchmarks\\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve done first ever benchmarking of the Conway ledger. To that end, we\'ve ported our Babbage workloads to Conway for\\nimmediate comparability. Fortunately, we\'ve have not found any performance regression in the Conway ledger.\\n\\n#### P2P benchmarks\\n\\nIn Q4, we\'ve validated P2P topology to be viable as default for both relay and block producer nodes. As a consequence, we\'ve switched\\nto P2P topology for benchmarking baselines ourselves.\\n\\n#### GHC9 performance\\n\\nIn Q4, evaluation of GHC9.2\'s and GHC9.6\'s optimizer in the context of the Cardano code base has been completed. \\nEventually, GHC9.6 has shown itself to be much more suitable from a performance perspective. We\'re convinced that\\nwith a few select annotations in the code, GHC9.6\'s optimizer can produce a result on par performance-wise with GHC8.10 - \\nwhich just was a great release in that regard. With GHC9.2 unfortunately, the changes would have to be more invasive - and thus more time-consuming.\\n\\n#### New nomad cluster\\n\\nWe\u2019ve moved the new Nomad cluster into production use and established new baselines for each workload on it. \\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve shut down the legacy `cardano-ops` benchmarking cluster, and archived all raw data from it.\\n\\n#### Consensus component QTAs\\n\\nWe\u2019ve developed the existing prototype into an automatable, self-contained benchmark called `beacon`, as well as systematized workloads and run structure for it.\\nMoreover, we\u2019ve demonstrated usefulness of the metrics, their reproducibility, and identified domains viable for QTAs with system-level benchmarks.\\n\\n#### New team member\\n\\nWe\'re happy to welcome a new joiner to our team! We\'ve successfully onboarded him in Q4; he has taken\\nover the `cardano-tracer` service - the node-external component of the new tracing system - and has already\\nlanded several valuable contributions."},{"id":"2023-Q4-consensus","metadata":{"permalink":"/quarterly/2023-Q4-consensus","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/quarterly/2023-Q4-consensus.md","source":"@site/quarterly/2023-Q4-consensus.md","title":"Consensus Q4 2023 Update","description":"Areas of focus","date":"2024-01-23T10:58:30.000Z","formattedDate":"January 23, 2024","tags":[{"label":"consensus","permalink":"/quarterly/tags/consensus"}],"readingTime":2.66,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Nadales","title":"Consensus Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/dnadales","imageURL":"https://github.com/dnadales.png","key":"dnadales"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Consensus Q4 2023 Update","slug":"2023-Q4-consensus","authors":"dnadales","tags":["consensus"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Q4 2023 Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2023-Q4-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"SRE Q4 2023 Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2023-Q4-sre"}},"content":"## Areas of focus\\n\\n| Issue                                                                 | Status  |\\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\\n| [Implement legacy mode for UTxO-HD to keep baseline performance][429] | \u2705 Done |\\n| [Assist mainnet node release with initial Conway capabilities][423]   | \u2705 Done |\\n| [Assist with test, benchmark, and improvements to CIP 1694][424]      | \u2705 Done |\\n| [Assist with P2P IOG relay network shut down][414]                    | \u2705 Done |\\n| [Assist with repo transfer to Intersect][425]                         | \u2705 Done |\\n| [Support vendors to deliver contracts][427]                           | \u2705 Done |\\n| [Operation serenity Q4 2023][415]                                     | \u2705 Done |\\n\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n### Implement legacy mode for UTxO-HD to keep baseline performance\\n\\n- \u2705 We managed to run a UTxO-HD capable node in legacy mode, maintaining the baseline memory usage while keeping all the ledger state in memory.\\n    - While the legacy mode is not production-ready (it requires further integration and testing), it remains as a plan B should the need arise to release UTxO-HD if our stakeholders so demand it.\\n- \u2705 We pivoted to redesigning the Ledger DB API because:\\n    - This is needed for integrating the LSM-tree backend.\\n\\t- The redesign opened the possibility of implementing an in-memory backend that would keep the same performance and resource requirements as the baseline version (which needs to be confirmed by benchmarks).\\n- \u2705 We created a more general Ledger DB API.\\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f We are integrating (into the feature branch) the existing Ledger DB implementations with the new API.\\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f We are implementing the new in-memory backend.\\n\\n### Assist mainnet node release with initial Conway capabilities, test, benchmark, and improvements to CIP 1694\\n\\n- \u2705  We recognized that Conway introduces a new challenge in the versioning of NTC queries, and we resolved it (see [864][864] and [4770][4770]).\\n\\n### Assist with P2P IOG relay network shut down\\n\\n- \u2705 We created a prototype for the pre-Genesis State Machine for bootstrap peers, which is currently under test (see [this PR][808]).\\n\\n### Assist with repo transfer to Intersect\\n\\n- \u2705 We transferred the `ouroboros-consensus` repository to the Intersect GitHub organization.\\n\\n### Support vendors to deliver contracts\\n\\n- Genesis\\n  - \u2705 Interacted with the Consensus team and addressed resulting feedback on past deliverables.\\n  - \u2705 Finished implementation of the testing infrastructure of Genesis\\n  - \u2705 Started to refine the Proof of Concept demo into an actual implementation of the core components of the Genesis design.\\n- \ud83d\udcbe LSM-tree implementation.

2023-09\\n\\n### Main achievements\\n\\n* Release benchmarking\\n* Developing and running UTxO-HD benchmarks - in-memory flavour\\n* P2P benchmarks, facilitating rollout\\n* Production-readiness of the new Nomad cluster has been reached\\n* Optimization of and introspection capability for the new tracing system\\n* GHC9 performance investigation (and possible remedy)\\n* Conensus QTAs: first real-world application of prototype\\n#### Release benchmarking\\n\\nOngoing release benchmarking is a crucial safeguard to `cardano-node`\'s release cycle from a performance perspective. We\'ve performed and analyzed benchmarks for node versions `8.2.x` to `8.5` throughout Q3.\\n\\n#### UTxO-HD benchmarks\\n\\nTargeting a specific new feature in benchmarks requires development effort and fine-tuning the machinery. In Q3, we achieved that for the in-memory flavour of UTxO-HD, enabling benchmark delivery.\\n\\n#### P2P benchmarks\\n\\nIn Q3, we performed additional P2P benchmarks to facilitate the comprehensive rollout of that feature.\\n\\n#### New nomad cluster\\n\\nThe new hardware cluster for benchmarks, which is controlled through the new nomad backend, has received \\nvarious rounds of validation and adjustments in Q3 - in addition to finalizing integration with the rest\\nof our pipeline. The confidence in metrics gathered on the cluster is now sufficient for us to consider it\\nready for production use.\\n\\n#### New tracing system\\n\\nOur new tracing system has received various rounds of optimization in Q3. We could verify in our benchmarks that\\nit is roughly on par with the legacy system while offering a richer feature set and greater flexibility.  \\n\\nAdditionally, in Q3 we equipped the system with an introspection capability. This is now used for generating\\nend user documentation that stays in-sync with definitions in code, and for automated consistency checking of the entire system.\\n\\n#### GHC9 performance\\n\\nIn Q3, a joint investigation with DevX into GHC9\'s behaviour revealed where and how GHC9 misses opportunities for\\noptimization of generated code. This led to an approach to annotate our codebase accordingly to re-enable\\nthose optimizations - which is still being validated.\\n\\n#### Consensus QTAs\\n\\nIn collaboration with Consensus and DevX, we advanced the Consensus QTAs prototype capturing ledger operations\'\\nperformance characteristics. It\'s now applicable, and being applied, to a real-world task - namely\\ngathering evidence of the effect of aforementioned changes allowing for performant GHC9 builds.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n#### Benchmarking:\\n\\nIn Q4, the focus will be on:\\n* facilitating the next mainnet release\\n* benchmarking runs in the Conway era\\n* developing benchmarks / workloads for Conway-exclusive actions\\n* implementing a specialized benchmark setup for the UTxO-HD on-disk variant\\n* developing new Plutus benchmarks to safeguard Plutus V3\\n* benchmarks regarding the rollout of P2P\\n\\n#### Performance\\n\\nFor certain blocking performance issues we\'ve located the cause, or even found a solution in a cross-team effort. In Q4 we\'ll advance that work to ensure the ongoing\\nrelease cycle for mainnet, as well as make GHC9 become a viable release platform.\\n\\n#### New tracing system\\n\\nFor the new tracing system, we\'ll finalize optimization - current results are already on par with the legacy system. Furthermore, we will finish up comprehensive documentation, as well as description of a recommended setup, for which we can provide initial support.\\n\\n#### UTxO-HD monitoring\\n\\nWe\'ll augment our analysis pipeline so it can process monitoring data from UTxO-HD nodes connected to mainnet in a meaningful way.\\n\\n#### Nomad backend\\n\\nFrom Q4 on, this backend will be in production use. We plan on adding various UX and flexibility improvements, and further fine-tuning some profiles for nomad.\\n\\n#### Workbench\\n\\nWe will prepare for a future move of our performance workbench into a separate project. This entails restructuring, refactoring and reimplementation of certain few components that currently assume to always be in sync with `cardano-node`.\\n\\n#### Consensus component QTAs (co-development)\\n\\nIn Q4 there will be ongoing work with and support for the existing prototype. We plan to identify a fixed set of input data that yields results of high informative value, and to formalize the process to a point that enables future automation."},{"id":"2023-Q3-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/quarterly/2023-Q3-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/quarterly/2023-Q3-sre.md","source":"@site/quarterly/2023-Q3-sre.md","title":"SRE Q3 2023 Update","description":"2023-07 -

2023-06\\n\\n### Main achievements\\n\\n#### Eclipse Evasion\\n\\nWe finalised the design of eclipse evasion and implemented its mechanism which\\nrelays on connectivity to _big ledger peers_.  _Big ledger peers_ are the\\nlargest ledger peers which accumulate 90% of stake (currently there are less\\nthan 1000 of them).  The outbound governor has new targets for _known_,\\n_established_ and _active_ big ledger peers which work in a similar way that\\nsuch targets work for ledger peers.  The [ouroboros-network#4662] PR is\\ncurrently in review.\\n\\nAs part of this work we also identified a bug which would prevent a node to\\nconnect to itself.  Such connections are not easily detectable and are expected\\nto be dropped by the churn mechanism, nonetheless they should not be buggy.\\nThe failure was discovered thanks to our e2e simulation of diffusion using\\n`io-sim` & property based testing.\\n\\nThe PR also refactors the heart of the `ouroboros-network` interface reducing\\ntechnical debt that would otherwise accumulate.\\n\\nWe also identified a possible improvement in the churn mechanism, which will be\\nimplemented in Q3.  Churn needs to await for peers to terminate, we can\\nimprove the synchronisation. [ouroboros-network#4617]\\n\\n#### Ecosystem P2P Deployment Progress\\n\\nWe reached __50% of stake in hands of SPOs who run at least on P2P relay__.  Now\\nalso Emurgo and CF are running some P2P relays. Also 20% of IOG relays are\\nrunning in P2P mode.\\n\\n![P2P Progress](/images/network/2023-07-06-p2p-progress.png)\\n\\n#### Peer Sharing\\n\\nWe implemented _bootstrapping for peer sharing_ (also known as light peer\\nsharing).  New downstream (inbound) peers are now added to the _known peers_ of\\nthe _outbound governor_.  Together with peer sharing this allows for non\\nregistered relays to propagate through the network. [ouroboros-network#3596]\\n\\n_Please note that peer sharing is disabled by default and is not considered safe\\nuntil Bootstrap Peers (see below) or Genesis is implemented._\\n\\n#### Diffusion (P2P)\\n\\n- We designed a feature which will reduce the load on IOG relays (in future\\n  also run by CF & Emurgo).  The feature consists of two parts.  A new source\\n  of peers called _bootstrap peers_ (obtained from via an https request), the\\n  ability to switch from bootstrap peers to ledger peers if the node is synced\\n  (we are collaborating with the consensus team on the interface [Bootstrap\\n  Peers IER][bootstrap-ier]).   This feature will be completed in Q3.\\n  [ouroboros-network#4530]\\n\\n- We published a blog post about [P2P design & implementation][p2p-blog].\\n\\n- Karl Knutsson (CF) fixed an issue observed on a relay with a lot of outbound connections:\\n  [ouroboros-network#4559].\\n\\n- We merged changes which allow the consensus layer to start / stop block\\n  forging thread.  This will allow to deploy P2P block producing nodes which\\n  serve as a live backup node. [ouroboros-consensus#140]\\n\\n- We fixed a few bugs in local root peers DNS resolution service:\\n  [ouroboros-network#4583], [ouroboros-network#4571].\\n\\n- We limited concurrency of DNS name resolutions: [ouroboros-network#4596].\\n\\n- Galois Inc implemented query option for Handshake: [ouroboros-network#4256].\\n\\n- We fixed handshake query timeout: [ouroboros-network#4608].\\n\\n- We implemented warm valency for local root peers.  This can help when using\\n  DNS names in local root peers which resolve to many IP addresses. [ouroboros-network#4575]\\n\\n- We merged handshake changes which allow query protocol versions.  Thanks to\\n  James Parker from Galois Inc.: [ouroboros-network#4256], [cardano-cli#30].\\n\\n### Other Improvements & Developments\\n\\n#### CDDL\\n\\n- We added `node-to-node` and `node-to-client` CDDL specs / tests for encoding\\n  of `NodeToNodeVersionData` and `NodeToClientVersionData`.  \\n\\n- We clarified an inconsistency between CDDL spec and implementation which is\\n  highly polymorphic.  We designed and implemented a fix for `tx-submission`\\n  and `local-tx-submission` mini-protocols.  Specs for other mini-protocols will\\n  be improved at a later stage. [ouroboros-network#4580]\\n\\n#### [Cardano Ping][cardano-ping]\\n\\n- `cardano-ping` command was deprecated in favour of `cardano-cli ping` (the\\n  transition was done by the `node` team).\\n\\n- Support for `node-to-client` protocol using Unix sockets.\\n  [ouroboros-network#4601]\\n\\n- Support for `NodeToNodeV_11` and `NodeToClientV_16`, [ouroboros-network#4587]\\n\\n- `cardano-cli ping` is now using _ISO8601_ format for timestamps.  Formatting of\\n  messages was improved. [ouroboros-network#4593]\\n\\n- `cardano-cli ping` has a new `--query-versions` flag which allows to query\\n    supported versions by the remote node.

achievements\\n\\n#### UTxO HD\\n\\n- We finished a major prototype refactoring, which includes:\\n    - A better and finer grained DB lock mechanism.\\n    - Elimination of race conditions.\\n    - Support for configuring batch query size and flushing rate. This is crucial to allow node users to tweak performance.\\n    - Architectural simplifications and performance improvements.\\n- We implemented a new package to support db-sync integration with UTxO-HD.\\n- We ran another set of ad-hoc benchmarks:\\n    - We uncovered a performance regression on the Network component when using `GHC-9.2/9.4`.\\n    - The synchronization and replay speed are as expected.\\n    - However, we uncovered memory consumption issues (see figure below).\\n        - The in-memory backend is consuming more memory than the baseline.\\n        - The LMDB backend shows an unexpected memory usage peak.\\n        - Investigation on these issues is ongoing.\\n- We integrated the latest changes in `main` branch.\\n    - This required a re-design of the mempool to include the mempool fairness\\n      improvement.\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2023-Q2-utxo-hd-sync-ad-hoc-benchmarks.png)\\n\\n#### Genesis\\n\\n- The Genesis work for this PI focused on an high-priority issue from the IOG Researchers\' feedback on the proposal.\\n    - This particular question was not anticipated when the Q2 PI was planned.\\n    - As a result, the chain generators work, the ChainSync Jumping performance work, and the Genesis node prototype work were deprioritized.\\n    - That work has accordingly been rolled over into the Statement of Work for the first Genesis vendor work package.\\n- The IOG Researchers\' feedback on the design was very valuable. It had two primary effects.\\n- Outcome 1: We re-introduced distinct behaviors when the node is \\"syncing\\" versus when it is \\"caught up\\".\\n    - This eliminated a DoS vector introduced by the proposal, instead of having to argue that it was well-mitigated.\\n    - The additional design complexity is relatively small.\\n- Outcome 2: The issue that was unanticipated is whether the Cardano chain is consistently dense enough to rely on Genesis without any checkpointing.\\n    - The determination so far is that---assuming the adversary never controls more than four of the seven genesis keys---the most vulnerable segment is in the pure Praos era.\\n    - All the preceding windows are significantly more robust, including the entire Byron and Transitional Praos eras.\\n    - Thus checkpointing is not necessary for the initial Genesis release, though it still may be a reasonable addition later.\\n    - The primary invention was a model for bounding how much benefit the adversary\'s long-range attack could possibly gain from Praos\'s natural short forks.\\n- Relevant questions that the IOG Researchers are still assessing.\\n    - These do not block the Genesis implementation, but do affect the ultimate values of specific parameters.\\n    - Question 1: what is the upper bound on the duration of an eclipse that a healthy Praos node will survive?\\n    - Question 2: what is the upper bound on how much grinding can improve the adversary\'s leader schedule within some Genesis window?\\n\\n#### Support\\n- We performed an analysis on number of file descriptors used by Consensus, this\\n  information can be used by the node operators to check if the number of file\\n  descriptors they want to support are enough, thus improving the user (eg node\\n  operator) experience.\\n- We implemented a mempool fairness improvement, by which transactions are\\n  guaranteed to be processed irrespective of their size.\\n\\n#### Technical debt\\n\\n- We fixed a bug in followers logic, which was discovered by our `QuickCheck`\\nproperty tests.\\n- We created an [immutable DB\\n  server](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/pull/68). This tool allows to serve blocks from the immutable DB to a node that connects to it. This has a remarkable value for testing and benchmarking purposes. For instance, by using this component, we can benchmark the performance of different aspects of Consensus, such as syncing from scratch, without adding Network interference in the performance results.\\n- We created a [`db-truncater`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/pull/70) tool, which can be used in disaster recovery and benchmarking scenarios.\\n- We created a [benchmarks comparison tool](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/pull/161) that we plan on using for comparing the performance of two Consensus releases. This will allow us to catch performance regressions early on in the process, before they make it to the node (and show in the system level benchmark tests), thus greatly saving development costs. As an example, the graph below shows the performance *improvements* introduced by the Ledger team in version `0.6.0.0` of Consensus wrt version `0.5.0.0`.\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2023-Q2-beacon-graph.png)\\n\\n#### Fostering collaboration\\n\\n- We released `fs-sim` as open-source repository. This lowers the barrier to entry for external contributors, which will indirectly benefit the Cardano project.\\n- We migrated the consensus code to a [new repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus), splitting\\nit from the `ouroboros-network` repository. This will save development effort for both the Network and the Consensus teams, since there will be less interference (for instance when making releases).\\n- We made several improvements to our release processes, which will translate in time savings. As an example, we went from 16 to 4 packages, which makes the release process simpler and smother. Our release process now makes it easier to align versions and make releases (both for us and for our downstream users).\\n- We added an explanation of the hardfork-combinator forecast horizon, that will benefit not only our team, but future external contributors.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n#### UTxO HD\\n\\n- We will [get UTxO-HD ready for handover](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/issues/28).\\n\\n#### Genesis\\n\\n- We will regularly liaise with the vendor(s) satisfying the Genesis Statement(s) of Work."},{"id":"2023-04-25-consensus","metadata":{"permalink":"/quarterly/2023-04-25-consensus","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/quarterly/2023-04-25-consensus.md","source":"@site/quarterly/2023-04-25-consensus.md","title":"Consensus Quarterly Update","description":"Consensus Quarterly Update","date":"2023-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 25, 2023","tags":[{"label":"consensus","permalink":"/quarterly/tags/consensus"}],"readingTime":2.3,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Nadales","title":"Consensus Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/dnadales","imageURL":"https://github.com/dnadales.png","key":"dnadales"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Consensus Quarterly Update","slug":"2023-04-25-consensus","authors":"dnadales","tags":["consensus"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Q2 2023 Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2023-Q2-consensus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Network Q1 2023 Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2023-04-04-network"}},"content":"## Consensus Quarterly Update\\n## 2023-01 - 2023-03\\n\\n### Main achievements\\n\\n#### UTxO HD\\n\\n- We finished the testing activities for the prototype, which involved adding\\n  new tests, and fixing and enabling temporarily disabled tests.\\n- We spent a substantial amount of effort refactoring and cleaning the\\n  prototype.\\n- We audited the UTxO HD prototype to make sure it can accommodate the migration\\n  of other tables (eg stake-keys registration) from memory to disk. The result\\n  of the audit was positive.\\n- We ran ad-hoc benchmarks for reading keys and flushing values to disk. No\\n  unexpected costs found.\\n- We ran the first system level benchmarks. The performance regressions reported\\n  were due to an unrealistic snapshotting rate. We need to re-run them again\\n  after we design a more fine grained locking mechanism.\\n\\n#### Genesis\\n\\n- We elaborated a roadmap of the remaining work for Genesis.\\n- We presented the design to the IOG Researchers and PNSol on February 20. The\\n  design was well received. We updated the Genesis design with the researcher\'s\\n  feedback.\\n    - We plugged the new DoS vector identified during the aforementioned\\n      presentation.\\n- We developed a generator for adversarial leader schedules that satisfy key\\n  Ouroboros properties, which will be used to test the Genesis design.\\n    - The generator enables use of smaller Ouroboros parameters, which makes\\n      extrema more likely and counterxamples easier interpret.\\n- We wrote up the latest design iteration.\\n- We continued benchmarking the Chain Sync Jumping prototype. In particular:\\n    - We debugged the prototype\'s performance regression, and unmasked the\\n      actual cause by patching our initial theory (bad queuing behavior)\\n    - We identified and validated the actual cause (a pathological case in\\n      BlockFetch tiebreaker).\\n\\n#### Support\\n\\n- We created two new tools. One for dumping CBOR encoded blocks to JSON. Ahother\\n  to serve a local immutable DB.\\n\\n#### Conway era\\n\\n- We integrated the Conway era into consensus.\\n\\n#### Technical debt\\n\\n- We fixed a bug with followers, which was discovered by property tests.\\n- We developed a DSL for specifying and running ChainDB test cases.\\n- We fixed failing tests with iterators.\\n- We created micro-benchmarks for adding transactions to the mempool.\\n\\n#### Fostering collaboration\\n\\n- We released a new technical documentation site for consensus.\\n- We factored out several packages to external repositories.

- 2023-03\\n\\n### Main achievements\\n\\n#### CIPs\\n\\n* **Entering the Voltaire phase** -\\n  CIP-1694 received a major update after participation in the design has expanded to\\n  more and more people, including those who attended the Colorado workshop.\\n  See [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380).\\n* **Ledger CIP category** -\\n  The ledger team continues to embrace the CIP process, and has begun the process of\\n  registering the ledger as an official CIP category.\\n  See [CIP-84](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456).\\n* **Ledger serialization** -\\n  A CIP for the ledger serialization deprecation cycle has been accepted.\\n  See [CIP-80](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0080).\\n\\n#### Formal ledger model\\n\\nOur new formal specifications backed by Agda have seen a lot of progress.\\nThe majority of the ideas in CIP-1694 are now present, and we have made enough progress\\nthat we can now safely say that the PDF produced by the Agda model will be the\\nofficial ledger specification for the Conway ledger era.\\nSee [the repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications).\\n\\n\\n#### Conway ledger era\\n\\nProgress on the Haskell implementation of CIP-1694 has gone hand in hand with the formal model.\\nThe major component still missing is the DRep stake distribution, which still presents some\\ntechnical challenges.\\n\\n[[pull-3176]]\\n[[pull-3216]]\\n[[pull-3226]]\\n[[pull-3291]]\\n[[pull-3326]]\\n[[pull-3330]]\\n[[pull-3339]]\\n\\n#### DRep stake distribution computation\\n\\nAdding another large stake distribution to the ledger state must proceed with caution.\\nWe do not want the memory used by the node to increase too much,\\nand performance problems can lead to reduced block production.\\nWe have prototyped, tested, and benchmarked several approaches that could give us\\nthe current DRep stake distribution at each epoch boundary.\\nThis has very important implications, since we want every ADA holder to be able to at any\\ntime (such as during a contentious vote) register themselves as a DRep and still have time\\nto vote themselves on the issue.\\n\\n[[pull-3344]]\\n[[pull-3353]]\\n[[pull-3364]]\\n\\n#### Integration work\\n\\nThe ledger has made some wonderful improvements over the past six months,\\nbut which entail a significant amount of integration efforts:\\n\\n* Our new versioned CBOR schemes\\n* Individual deposit tracking\\n* An improved cross-era interface utilizing lenses\\n* A new ledger API\\n* Re-arranging the ledger stake in preparation for CIP-1694\\n* Versioning our Haskell packages\\n  using [CHaPs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-haskell-packages).\\n* Consistent conventions for variable names\\n\\n\\n[[pull-3279]]\\n[[pull-3282]]\\n[[pull-3288]]\\n[[pull-3289]]\\n[[pull-3292]]\\n[[pull-3297]]\\n[[pull-3298]]\\n[[pull-3299]]\\n[[pull-3300]]\\n[[pull-3302]]\\n[[pull-3303]]\\n[[pull-3308]]\\n[[pull-3342]]\\n[[pull-3345]]\\n[[pull-3356]]\\n[[pull-3357]]\\n[[pull-3360]]\\n[[pull-3361]]\\n[[pull-3363]]\\n[[pull-4349]]\\n[[pull-378]]\\n[[pull-376]]\\n[[pull-373]]\\n[[pull-370]]\\n[[pull-361]]\\n[[pull-4976]]\\n[[pull-5013]]\\n\\n#### Deposit tracking\\n\\nIndividual deposits (for stake credential and stake pool registrations) were not tracked by the ledger.\\nDeposits were returned according to the current protocol parameters.\\nWhen the values of these two protocol parameters change, the deposit pot\\nis adjusted by adding to, or removing from, the reserves.\\n\\nThis has several problems:\\n* Most people expect a deposit to be paid back exactly.\\n* We cannot increase the deposit amount once the reserves hits zero.\\n* If it becomes known that the deposit amount is going to be increased, free Lovelace can be earned by registering credentials.\\n* Because of the problems above, it is going to be incredibly hard to ever change the values.\\n* There is a serious issue involving hard forks.\\n  The consensus layer makes the decision about whether or not to enact a hard fork based on\\n  the protocol parameter update state two stability windows before the end of the epoch.\\n  However, the ledger will reject a protocol parameter update on the epoch boundary\\n  if the deposit pot adjustments cannot be reconciled with the reseve pot.\\n  This means that if quorum is met regarding changing the major protocol version,\\n  but the update is rejected on the epoch boundary, consensus will change the era but the\\n  ledger will not change the major protocol version, leaving the ledger in a split-brain state.\\n\\nBecause we never actually changed the values of the two deposits amounts in the protocol parameters\\non mainnet, we were able to retroactively change the behavior.\\nWe made the following changes:\\n  * Individual deposits are tracked in the `DState`.\\n  * The amount deposited is always returned.\\n\\n[[pull-3195]]\\n[[pull-3202]]\\n[[pull-3217]]\\n\\n#### New ledger API\\n\\nWe have significantly built up the ledger API.\\nWe will eventually replace much of the `cardano-api` in the node repository with this ledger API.\\n\\n[[pull-3242]]\\n[[pull-3248]]\\n[[pull-3328]]\\n\\n#### Constraint-based generators\\n\\nOur largest scale property tests generate an initial ledger state and a long sequence of valid blocks\\nwhich span several epochs, mimicking a real network.\\nThese tests are, in theory, excellent for checking properties.\\nThey are, however, very difficult to maintain and are not as random as we would like\\n(a lot of bias has to be introduced to keep the ledger state in enough order to keep generating blocks).\\n\\nWe have a new declaritive infrastructure for building constraint-based generators,\\nwhich instead generate a random ledger state representative of not just an initial state,\\nbut also those representative of the end result of a long sequence of valid blocks.\\nMoreover, these generators are very fast and are much more random than our old generators.\\nBefore we can start using them for our existing property tests, however, we still need to\\nexpand them to generate a valid block for a given ledger state.\\n\\n[[pull-3219]]\\n\\n#### Technical debt\\n\\nWe continued to address technical debt as much as we can.\\n\\n[[pull-3167]]\\n[[pull-3170]]\\n[[pull-3172]]\\n[[pull-3175]]\\n[[pull-3184]]\\n[[pull-3205]]\\n[[pull-3208]]\\n[[pull-3210]]\\n[[pull-3212]]\\n[[pull-3218]]\\n[[pull-3222]]\\n[[pull-3223]]\\n[[pull-3224]]\\n[[pull-3225]]\\n[[pull-3229]]\\n[[pull-3239]]\\n[[pull-3241]]\\n[[pull-3244]]\\n[[pull-3245]]\\n[[pull-3249]]\\n[[pull-3260]]\\n[[pull-3263]]\\n[[pull-3264]]\\n[[pull-3268]]\\n[[pull-3269]]\\n[[pull-3270]]\\n[[pull-3274]]\\n[[pull-3276]]\\n[[pull-3277]]\\n[[pull-3286]]\\n[[pull-3290]]\\n[[pull-3295]]\\n[[pull-3296]]\\n[[pull-3306]]\\n[[pull-3307]]\\n[[pull-3310]]\\n[[pull-3311]]\\n[[pull-3316]]\\n[[pull-3320]]\\n[[pull-3323]]\\n[[pull-3327]]\\n[[pull-3331]]\\n[[pull-3332]]\\n[[pull-3333]]\\n[[pull-3338]]\\n[[pull-3341]]\\n[[pull-3347]]\\n[[pull-3350]]\\n[[pull-3351]]\\n[[pull-3352]]\\n[[pull-3354]]\\n\\n##### Critical fixes\\n\\nWe fixed two critical issues:\\n* Growing block production delay on the epoch boundary: [[pull-3209]]\\n* Unexpected node shutdown from `balanceR`: [[pull-3343]]\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n* **Conway spec** -\\n  Complete the first version of the conway formal specification.\\n* **DRep stake distribution** -\\n  Have the ledger compute the DRep stake distribution with acceptible performance.\\n* **Devnet ready** -\\n  Have the Haskell implementation of the conway era in sync with the formal specification,\\n  and integrate the changes with consensus and node.\\n  All the details might not be finalized, but the wire specification and the API should\\n  be stable so that conway can be placed on a devnet for tool builders to start integrating with.\\n* **Plutus V3** -\\n  Integrate Plutus V3 into the ledger, including a new script context which supports DReps.\\n\\n### More details\\n\\nThis quarterly report was based off of the following fortnightly ones:\\n\\n* [2023-01-05](2023-01-05-ledger)\\n* [2023-01-19](2023-01-19-ledger)\\n* [2023-02-02](2023-02-02-ledger)\\n* [2023-02-17](2023-02-17-ledger)\\n* [2023-03-03](2023-03-03-ledger)\\n*

2023-01\\n\\n### Main achievements\\n\\n#### UTxO HD\\n\\nThe prototype is feature complete and thoroughly tested at the consensus level.\\nIn particular, we invested a lot of time in writing property-test for the\\nmempool, and other crucial new parts of the prototype. Now we are ready to run\\nintegration tests and system-level benchmarks.\\n\\n#### Genesis\\n\\nWe identified and fixed a slowdown in cross-era forecasting that was inhibiting\\nour efforts to benchmark the ChainSync Jumping prototype. This resulted in a 7%\\nspeedup in full sync times in the baseline.\\n\\nWe also started prototyping a self-contained implementation of the Genesis\\ndynamics (in particular of the parts intentionally not part of the ChainSync\\nJumping prototype) that furthered our understanding of subtleties and edge\\ncases.\\n\\n#### Support\\n\\n- We worked on designing integration of new VRF and KES crypto into consensus.\\n    - `Crypto` class was split into two parts: `Crypto` and `HeaderCrypto`.\\n    - With the Ledger team\'s help, we refactored `cardano-ledger` to use a proxy\\n      type for VRF.\\n\\n#### Conway era\\n\\n- PR went through its second review round. It is about to be merged, but it got\\n  delayed due to people\'s availability during Christmas break.\\n\\n#### Technical debt\\n\\n- We improved the capabilities of our `io-sim` library, which is key for testing\\n  and simulating Cardano components.\\n- We removed thunks from epoch translations in the ledger, which is important\\n  for reducing memory consumption of the Cardano node.\\n\\n#### Fostering collaboration\\n\\n- We added a tutorial on how to instantiate the Consensus layer to run custom\\n  ledgers. This should be a valuable resource to people looking to roll their\\n  own custom blockchain (either for commercial or research purposes).\\n- We added an overview of consensus to the [top level\\n  documentation](https://ouroboros-network.cardano.intersectmbo.org/) of\\n  ouroboros-network. This overview describes the consensus components and adds a\\n  hyperlinked map to the modules documentation.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n#### UTxO HD\\n\\n- Evaluate the extensibility of the prototype. Moving the UTxO to disk is only\\n  the first step towards reducing the memory requirements of Cardano node, and\\n  ensuring its long term sustainability. In the future, we plan on moving other\\n  large maps, such as delegation maps. The prototype should be able to\\n  accommodate these changes without any major modifications.\\n- Start the integration with other downstream components, such as the wallet and\\n  db-sync. The idea is to identify and address any potential pain points that\\n  might arise during this integration.\\n- Run integration tests and system-level benchmarks.\\n\\n#### Genesis\\n\\n- Finish benchmarking and tuning the fast-path ChainSync Jumping prototype\\n- Expand and optimize the self-contained implementation of the Disconnect Rule\\n  (including density comparisons and the LoE)\\n- Develop documentation and smoke tests for these components.\\n- Start modifying the ChainSync Client for the LoP and LoR.\\n\\n#### Support\\n\\n- Help the Network team with diagnosing performance regression in block\\n  production.\\n\\n#### Tech debt\\n\\n- Fix property-test failures concerning iterators ([#3999][issue-3999] and\\n  [#4183][issue-4183]).\\n\\n#### Fostering collaboration\\n\\n- Finish [mapping consensus][issue-4145].\\n\\n### Risks \\n\\n#### UTxO HD\\n\\n- Moving other parts of the ledger state to disk might require a major redesign\\n  of the prototype.

We fixed a number of small late bugs, and concluded QA\\n& performance testing.  Although it was discovered a regression in performance\\nof  block production when P2P is enabled, relaying with P2P performs better\\ncomparing to a non p2p.  We concluded that this is not a blocker for the Single\\nRelay Release which is planned shortly.\\n\\n[Peer sharing][pr #4019] has gone through review and final review is\\njust being done right now.  After merging it will still be disabled (hidden\\nbehind a flag) as it\'s not safe without eclipse evasion.  We started\\nimplementing light peer sharing (i.e. include inbound peers into known peer set\\nof the outbound governor).\\n\\nWe started a detailed eclipse evasion design, it will continue in the next\\nquarter.\\n\\nWe also made a major revision of package structure of the network packages.  We\\nended up with a very clean dependency graph ([pr #4155]).\\n\\nArmando Santos delivered a talk at the [ODOPIS 2022] conference on principles\\nof distributed systems in Brussels.  The slides are available [here][ODOPIS-slides].\\n\\nNeil Davies gave an invited seminar on `DeltaQ` at Universit\xe9 Catholique de\\nLouvain.\\n\\nWe also found and fixed a few of bugs:\\n\\n* a bug in keep alive mini-protocol which resulted in warm to cold transitions\\n  to be always executed through a timeout path rather than do a clean demotion\\n  ([pr #4168]).\\n\\n* fixed an assetion failure in the outbound governor ([issue #4177]) \\n\\n- we fixed DNS test failure [issue #4191]\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nWe will work towards the next release of P2P for block producer nodes.  This includes:\\n\\n* analysing performance regression for BP nodes when using P2P\\n* finish the work on controlling the block forger through node kernel ([pr #3800])\\n* address [issue #3907] and write a script to analyse deployment of P2P relays\\n\\nWe would like also to push forward eclipse evasion.   Although most of the work\\nhas be done already the release of `io-sim` on `Hackage` will happen in the\\nnext quarter.\\n\\nWe would also like to address [chain-sync timeout issue][issue #4244] recently\\ndiagnosed by Karl Knutsson.\\n\\nIf time permits we would also like to address some technical debt, especially:\\n\\n- [enable nothunk in diffusion tests][issue #3387]\\n- [refactor diffusion testnet simulation][issue #4085]\\n\\n### Risks\\n\\nThe performance regression for block producer with P2P needs to be investigated\\nin the near future.  This is blocker for the release of P2P on BP nodes.\\n\\n### Detailed log\\n\\n#### Contributions to Ouroboros-Network\\n\\n- We added `TraceDemoteLocalAsynchronous`, which enables notification of critical issues for SPOs\\n- We fixed `cardano-ping` compatibility with `NodeToNodeV_10` (P2P, [pr #4165])\\n- We fixed a bug in demotion peers to cold which affected P2P nodes ([commit-61058aa5c2])\\n- Karl Knutsson enhanced `SendFetchRequest` ([commit-bb1c3dddee]), open-source contribution)\\n- We turned `SizeInBytes` into a newtype.\\n- We extended `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`.\\n- We fixed DNS test failure [issue #4191]\\n- We fixed a simulation bug found in [issue #4258]\\n- [pr #4168]\\n- [issue #4177]\\n\\n#### Contributions to Cardano-Node\\n\\n- We maintained the Single Relay Release [pr #4612], (e.g. fixing CI issues,\\n  Rebasing it when necessary, publishing packages to Cardano Haskell Packages);\\n- We enhanced `JSON` serialisation / deserialisation of `NodeToNodeVersion` and `NodeToClientVersion`;\\n\\n#### Contributions to IOSim\\n\\n- We started to use Cardano Haskell Packages for `IOSim` ([pr #48])\\n- We updated change log files\\n- We added support of `ghc-9.4` ([pr #50])\\n\\nWe also addressed the following issues in [pr #57] in order to prepare the package for publication on Hackage:\\n\\n- refactored `io-classes` timers API ([issue #46]);\\n- created a new package `si-timers` which exposes an interface using SI units\\n  and is safe on 32-bit systems ([issue #59]);\\n- added monad transformers instances for classes defined in `io-classes` ([issue #58]);\\n- created `io-classes-mtl` package which includes (experimental) instances for monad transformers;\\n- provide `MonadMonotonicTimeNSec` in `io-classes` and `MonadMonotonicTime` in `si-timers` (so that `io-classes` follow the `base` package);\\n- added  `registerCancellableDelay` in `si-timers` (which allowed us to hide fancy timer api and clean `io-classes`)\\n- added support for `js_HOST_ARCH` (the new GHC JS backend)\\n\\nNote the [pr #57] contains almost 40 commits, and was a major step forward for\\n`io-sim` ecosystem.  We also prepared a draft [pr #4281] which updates\\n`ouroboros-network`.\\n\\nOther changes for `1.0.0.0` release on Hackage:\\n\\n- Refactored test suite ([pr #47])\\n- Updated documentation, cabal files, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY` documents, etc in [pr #60], currently under review.\\n\\n[commit-61058aa5c2]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4170/commits/61058aa5c28a144d723aae183d1745552d757334\\n[commit-bb1c3dddee]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4170/commits/bb1c3dddeea78949f531c144bb4f2669eddf7f47\\n[issue #3387]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3387\\n[issue #3907]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3907\\n[issue #4085]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4085\\n[issue #4168]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4168\\n[issue #4177]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4177\\n[issue #4191]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4191\\n[issue #4244]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4244\\n[issue #4258]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4258\\n[issue #46]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/issues/46\\n[issue #58]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/issues/58\\n[issue #59]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/issues/59\\n[pr #3800]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3800\\n[pr #4019]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4019\\n[pr #4155]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4155\\n[pr #4165]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4165\\n[pr #4281]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/4281\\n[pr #4612]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/4612\\n[pr #47]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/47\\n[pr #48]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/48\\n[pr #49]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/49\\n[pr #50]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/50\\n[pr #57]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/57\\n[pr #60]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/60\\n[ODOPIS 2022]: https://sites.uclouvain.be/OPODIS2022/armando-details.html\\n[ODOPIS-slides]: https://sites.uclouvain.be/OPODIS2022/slides/OPODIS2022-slides-Santos.pdf"},{"id":"2023-01-13-open-source","metadata":{"permalink":"/quarterly/2023-01-13-open-source","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/quarterly/2023-01-13-open-source.md","source":"@site/quarterly/2023-01-13-open-source.md","title":"Open-Source Update","description":"Open Source Quarterly Update","date":"2023-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 13, 2023","tags":[{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/quarterly/tags/open-source"}],"readingTime":2.215,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Open-Source Update","slug":"2023-01-13-open-source","authors":"coot","tags":["open-source"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Network Quarterly Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2023-01-13-network"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Quarterly Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2022-11-15-consensus"}},"content":"## Open Source Quarterly Update\\n## 2022-11 - 2023-01\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nIn the last quarter the open-source initiative delivered a comprehensive report\\non the state of our repositories.  As part of this work stream we\\nidentified the key open-source repositories for the cardano project across all\\nthe projects  From a list of more than 500 repositories (some of which are\\nforks) we identified key repositories which constitute the core of Cardano.\\n20 of them were identified as to be transferred to the future MBO which will\\ngovern Cardano development.  Some where excluded (like [`io-sim`] and\\n[`typed-protocols`]), to be govern by IOG, since they have a much broader\\napplication than Cardano itself, and thus we think their open-source future\\nwill be better outside of the Cardano umbrella.\\n\\nChristian Taylor identified a number of ways we can improve our repositories to\\nmake them more attractive for open-source contributions by analysing each of\\nthem.  This includes adding or improving various documentation files, like\\n`CONTRIBUTING` files, adding code of conduct, improving readme files, issue\\n& pull request templates etc.  Christian also computed various interesting\\nmetrics which gives a very good insight into the development practices: e.g.\\naverage merge ratio, average number of reviews, comments and many more!  The\\npresentation is available [here][open-source-presentation].\\n\\nWe followed with work on the [Cardano Engineering Handbook][CEH].  We included\\na standard code of conduct which is now used by most important projects in the\\nCardano space.  We included `cardano-node`\'s security policy and added\\na responsible disclosure policy.  We also described how roles and\\nresponsibilities should be clarified.  This progress was made by\\na collaborative effort of the Cardano Core, Plutus and Architecture teams, and\\nit wouldn\'t be possible without Michael Peyton Jones, Arnaud Bailly, Kevin\\nHammond, Jared Corduan and Marcin Szamotulski.\\n\\nWe also improved the documentation of key repositories, by adding description,\\nimproving their `README` file & `CONTRIBUTING` files, adding code of conducts\\nfollowing the [Cardano Engineering Handbook][CEH].

In\\n  particular, we added property tests for:\\n  - Backing store (work ongoing)\\n  - Era transitions\\n\\n- The property tests we added uncovered several bugs, which is a great result\\n  given the exponential increase in the cost of finding bugs as they are closer\\n  to deployment.\\n\\n- One of the errors found by our tests required us to work on improvements in\\n  the Haskell bindings for LMDB. This work is ongoing.\\n\\n- We started working on the mempool property tests that will exercise the new\\n  code paths that UTxO HD introduced.\\n\\n- We developed, benchmarked and tested an implementation of sequences of\\n  differences based on \\"anti-diffs\\". Performance results of diff sequence\\n  operations show that we achieved a speedup of about `4x` across several\\n  scenarios. Note: this speedup is taking into account diff sequence operations\\n  only, so the consensus-wide speedup is less than `4x`.\\n\\n- We integrated the \\"anti-diff\\" prototype into the UTxO HD feature branch.\\n\\n#### Genesis\\n\\n- We wrote a simulator that demonstrates soundness of an abstract implementation\\n  of the new chain selection rule.\\n- We elaborated a draft specification for the Genesis implementation (currently\\n  awaiting feedback from other architects).\\n- We elaborated a draft specification for the ChainSync Jumping optimization. In\\n  particular, this includes a proof sketch that the latter preserves liveness\\n  and safety in all cases.\\n- With the Networking team, we co-designed the eclipse avoidance mechanism,\\n  specifically its coherence with the Genesis implementation plan\'s security\\n  and its dependence on the new ChainSync Jumping optimization.\\n- We implemented a prototype for ChainSync Jumping. Initial benchmarks showed a\\n  performance degradation wrt the baseline. Our optimization attempts so far\\n  have brought the performance closer to the baseline, but not yet to parity.\\n\\n#### Conway era\\n\\n- We did most of the heavy lifting required to integrate the Conway era into the\\n  Consensus layer.\\n\\n#### Technical debt\\n\\n- We started working on enabling CI nightly tests, which revealed several test\\n  failures due to thunks being found it data structures used by the ledger and\\n  consensus. We made a lot of progress fixing those thunk errors, but some\\n  errors still remain.\\n\\n- We elaborated a `db-analyser` benchmark for the ledger operations. This led us\\n  to the identification of high processing time at epoch boundaries, and we\\n  could not observe any performance degradation that can be attributed to era\\n  changes.\\n\\n- We fixed a source of flakiness in the ChainDB QSM test.\\n\\n- We clarified a common source of confusion around VRF tie-breaking and\\n  cross-era chain selection.\\n\\n- We fixed a bug in the maximum-allowed ledger major protocol version.\\n\\n#### Fostering collaboration\\n\\n- We spent time making `cardano-updates` the central source of information for\\n  the core teams stakeholders.\\n- We went through the Galois gap analysis and extracted actionable points to\\n  take on next.\\n- Bart and Yogesh continued with their onboarding and stated making substantial\\n  contributions to consensus.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\n#### UTxO HD\\n\\n- Finish the mempool property tests.\\n- Benchmark the latest version of the prototype.\\n- Elaborate a document that describes new integration test scenarios and pass it\\n  to the SDET team.\\n- Bring query UTxO by address command performance on par with the baseline\\n  version.\\n\\n#### Genesis\\n\\n- Receive and incorporate Duncan\'s feedback on the first draft specification for\\n  the Genesis implementation.\\n- Begin prototyping the first genesis implementation, unless the first draft\\n  needs major changes.\\n- Draft a second revision of the Genesis report.\\n- Review the second revision with a wider audience, which includes at least\\n  Alexander Russell. That feedback will drive a third and hopefully final\\n  revision.\\n- Investigate how to mitigate the ~30% slowdown we have observed so far in the\\n  ChainSync jumping prototype, and try to mitigate it. In particular, we might\\n  need to optimize the existing BlockFetch logic.\\n\\n#### Tech debt\\n\\n- Enabling nightly CI tests.\\n\\n#### Fostering collaboration\\n\\n- Merge the tutorial document Galois wrote; requires CI integration.\\n- Come up with our own documentation improvements, many of which were suggested\\n  in the Galois gap analysis.\\n- Try to hire a new team member."},{"id":"2022-11-09-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/quarterly/2022-11-09-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/quarterly/2022-11-09-network.md","source":"@site/quarterly/2022-11-09-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"Network Quarterly Update","date":"2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 9, 2022","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/quarterly/tags/network"}],"readingTime":3.87,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2022-11-09-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Quarterly Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2022-11-15-consensus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2022-11-07-ledger"}},"content":"## Network Quarterly Update\\n## 2022-09 - 2022-11\\n\\n### Summary of most important improvements\\n\\nDuring this quarter the networking team delivered low level specification of\\npeer sharing & eclipse evasion.

We expanded our diffusion simulation to cover such case and\\n  also mitigated a chance for reintroducing such a bug in future.\\n\\n* We identified and quite likely mitigated a misconfiguration in the\\n  benchmarking cluster (next benchmarking run will confirm our hypothesis).\\n\\n* We simplified the format of p2p topology file, we got positive feedback from\\n  SPOs.\\n\\n* We raised severities of some of the logging messages, which is an important\\n  improvement for SPOs, exchanges and other users of the system.\\n\\n* We worked on input endorsers simulation which gives both animated and\\n  quantified live feedback on network operation, using a simplified model of\\n  a TCP/IP network. \\n\\n## Next quarter\\n\\n* Release the Single Relay P2P Release `1.35.5`.\\n\\n* Carry on with Peer Sharing (review, testing).\\n\\n* Deliver a talk at [Conference on Principles of Distributed Systems 2022][OPODIS2022] in Brussels, Belgium.\\n\\n* Present Detailed Design of Eclipse Evasion and start implementation phase.\\n\\n* Work on P2P Block Producer release.\\n\\n* Carry on with publishing of `io-sim` on `Hackage`.\\n\\n[OPODIS2022]: https://sites.uclouvain.be/OPODIS2022/ \\n[peer-sharing-design]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/wiki/Peer-Sharing-Implementation-Plan\\n[peer-sharing-pr]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4019\\n[p2p-release]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4120\\n[exit-policy]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3785\\n[peer-metrics]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3915\\n[socket-activation]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3979\\n[topology-file]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/4563\\n[dns-ttl]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4106\\n[consensus-startup-trace]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4015\\n[demotion-trace]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4127\\n[idle-timeout]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3844\\n[pr-3800]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3800\\n[pr-3690]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3968"},{"id":"2022-11-07-ledger","metadata":{"permalink":"/quarterly/2022-11-07-ledger","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/quarterly/2022-11-07-ledger.md","source":"@site/quarterly/2022-11-07-ledger.md","title":"Ledger Team Update","description":"Ledger Quarterly Update","date":"2022-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"ledger","permalink":"/quarterly/tags/ledger"}],"readingTime":1.255,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jared Corduan","title":"Ledger Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/JaredCorduan","imageURL":"https://github.com/JaredCorduan.png","key":"JaredCorduan"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","slug":"2022-11-07-ledger","authors":"JaredCorduan","tags":["ledger"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Network Team Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2022-11-09-network"},"nextItem":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","permalink":"/quarterly/2022-10-07-node-cli-api"}},"content":"## Ledger Quarterly Update\\n## 2022-09 - 2022-11-04\\n\\n* We finished a minimal ledger era capable of master key rotation.\\n  This will be re-purposed our upcoming work.\\n* We have the humble beginnings of a proper ledger API.\\n* We improved the problematic cost model serialization\\n  (recall the song and dance about updating the cost model one epoch after the hard fork).\\n* We have added benchmarks for problematic areas.\\n* Massive repository restructure and cleanup.\\n  * Unified and consistent variable name schemes (not completely finished, but nearly there).\\n  * Massive reduction in type constraints, which causes a lot of developer friction,\\n    in our code and also downstream.\\n  * More organized module structures.\\n  * Improved generators for our property tests.\\n  * We removed our dependency on cardano-prelude.\\n* The formal ledger model has come a long way.\\n  * We created a fork of Agda that provides some meta-programming support for the ledger rules.\\n  * We have a large amount of the basic UTxO support in the model.\\n  * We can generate a good looking PDF from the model.\\n  * We can produce Haskell from the model.\\n  * We have a nice finite set theory library that we can use for many of the ledger rules.\\n  * We have nix support for the model.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\n  * Individual tracking of deposits.

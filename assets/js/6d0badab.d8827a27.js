We could determine both to be free of performance regressions. The `10.6.2` release contains the new \'Defensive Mempool\' feature, which\\nis therefore also covered by our benchmark. The `10.6.2` release has shown to be somewhat more efficient in its use of CPU time, but exhibited a slightly higher tendency to perform Major GC cycles.  \\n\\nTo that end, we\'ve reopened an old PR which changes the default / recommended GC settings for the Node process to a parallel, load-balanced GC ([cardano-node PR#6222]). The motivation is to update the current recommended settings (which are still tuned to GHC8.10) such\\nthat the ocurrence of Major GC cycles is greatly reduced (as they may temporarily halt the Node process to complete). We found in our benchmark that, apart from being even slightly more efficient regarding CPU time, the occurrence of Major GCs could\\nbe reduced by almost factor 30.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWe\'re performing an overhaul of the `plutus-scripts-bench` package, a library of benchmarkable Plutus scripts targeting various aspects of the Plutus interpreter, the respective cost model and the execution budgets. The aim is\\nto create up-to-date performance baselines by using exclusively `PlutusV3` scripts that have been built with a recent version of the compiler - thus factoring in potential performance improvements in generated code.\\nCurrently, the PR [cardano-node PR#6440] is work in progress.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nUp to now, a benchmarking deployment required the target commit to be a public item on GitHub; the `nix` build (or cache retrieval from our CI) would be decentralized, with each cluster instance creating the benchmarking artifact independently.\\nWhen there\'s a requirement to benchmark security-critical changes in an isolated, opaque fashion, this approach would reach its limits promptly. Together with SRE, we devised a way to achieve just that: An artifact can be built from a local commit on one\\ncluster instance into its `nix` store, which in turn will serve as a substituter (i.e. cache) in a centralized manner for all other instances ([cardano-node PR#6450]).\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe new tracing system highly encourages trace values to be lazy. Thus, the emitting thread has the lowest possible overhead when doing so - which is highly relevant when you\'re on a hot code path. Furthermore, this overhead is assumed\\nto be a constant factor - regardless of whether those traces are consumed by any subscriber or not. We\'re currently exploring an approach to increase robustness, guarding against shaky implementations of trace values themselves. The burden\\nof evaluating a lazy trace still remains with a subscriber, however, this is now decoupled from handing over the trace result (such as a log line, a metric, etc.). By forcing a lazy trace value in a controlled section of code, immediately prior\\nto handover, the system will reliably handle even blatant implementation errors in lazy traces.\\n\\n### Leios\\n\\nThe Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) Trace Verifier [Cardano Trace LTL] has reached production readiness. It is able to ingest multiple streams of trace evidence, basically multiple Node log files as they\'re being produced, and\\ncontinuously evaluate a set of LTL propositions against them. While performant, real-time evaluation is a valuable thing to have, it required some of the LTL operators to be bounded to be able to operate in constant space over a long time.\\nWe\'ve discussed our fragment of LTL with Formal Methods to start building a collection of properties worth checking, and to ensure there\'s provably no disjoint semantics introduced by the bounded operators.  \\n\\nThe service is currently being integrated with the existing tooling in the `cardano-node` project, and will form a regular part of Leios setups / deployments in the future.\\n\\n### Node Diversity\\n\\nWe\'ve reached basic viability of the comprehensive formal schema definition of all the Node\'s existing trace messages. We\'re building an automated verification suite that will ensure all definitions are fully compliant\\nwith existing JSON schema, as well as the observables implemented in (and the trace messages logged by) the Haskell Node conform to the defined schema. Further manual refinement of types in the schema will be the next step; eventually,\\nthis will serve as a basis to automatically derive parsers, and to render a human-readable reference documentation.    \\n\\nThe implementation of our trace / metrics forwarding mini-protocol in Rust has completed and is now in testing phase. After cleanup and merge, this allows Rust projects to emit Cardano-style structured traces directly, and forward them to a running\\n`cardano-tracer` for logging, processing and metrics exposition.\\n\\n\\n[cardano-node PR#6222]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6222\\n[cardano-node PR#6440]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6440\\n[cardano-node PR#6450]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6450\\n[Cardano Trace LTL]: https://github.com/jutaro/cardano-trace-ltl"},{"id":"2026-02-18-mithril","metadata":{"permalink":"/2026-02-18-mithril","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2026-02-18-mithril.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-02-18-mithril.md","title":"Mithril Team Update","description":"High level overview","date":"2026-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 18, 2026","tags":[{"label":"mithril","permalink":"/tags/mithril"}],"readingTime":1.89,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Philippe Raynaud","title":"Mithril Tech Lead","url":"https://github.com/jpraynaud","imageURL":"https://github.com/jpraynaud.png","key":"jpraynaud"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Mithril Team Update","slug":"2026-02-18-mithril","authors":"jpraynaud","tags":["mithril"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2026-02-25-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Network Team Update","permalink":"/2026-02-16-network"}},"content":"## High level overview\\n\\nThis week, the Mithril team focused on implementing new succinct proofs.

Small improvements to default configs.\\n* **Node Diversity**: Comprehensive formal schema definition for trace messages; Proof-of-concept: Trace forwarding in native Rust.\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nWe\'ve re-established performance baselines for both the `10.5` and `10.6` branches of Node releases. When many small changes accumulate over time, it\'s necessary to factor them into the baseline (unless they show regressions) - otherwise\\none loeses the ability to efficiently localize underlying causes of performance metric changes.  \\n\\nLast month\'s cluster benchmark of LSM-trees pointed towards a space leak in the integration. To be certain, we successfully aimed to locally recreate network behaviour that was observed in the cluster. With this at hand, Consensus engineers\\nmanaged to localize it and create a potential fix - validation on the cluster still outstanding.  \\n\\nIn the meantime, the benchmarking profiles targeting on-disk LSM-trees have been solidified, merged to `master` and eternalized in our encyclopedia of benchmarking profiles `cardano-profile`. \\n\\n### Development\\n\\nThe trace consumer and processor service `cardano-tracer` is currently being upgraded with optionally HTTPS enabled connections. For scraping or browsing Node metrics, in case the connection crosses public networks, it\'s highly recommended to encrypt traffic. So far\\nthis has to be achieved by placing `cardano-tracer` behind a webserver proxy which speaks HTTPS; with the planned change `cardano-tracer` can be configured to do this directly when provided with the relevant certificates.  \\n\\nThe work on aggregating timeseries of Node metrics and evaluating `PromQL`-like queries over them is almost complete. Currently, it\'s a standalone application; we\'re planning to integrate it into `cardano-tracer` as a next step. We\'ve had SRE review\\nthe up to now unnamed query language for conciseness and utility - a sort of UAT if you will. This building block forms the foundation for alerts or monitoring dashboard data queries, which in the future can be handled directly by `cardano-tracer`, if so desired.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe integration of the [Typst] typesetting document compiler into our reporting pipeline is completed and merged to `master` in [cardano-node PR#6418]. Not only does that enable richer document features for the future; it also compiles\\nmuch faster than the previos Emacs Org mode / LaTeX based pipeline - and produces smaller and more accessible PDF files. The PR also drops a `nix` flake input required by the previous pipeline, which should result in smaller and faster workbench\\nbuilds both locally and in CI - and de-risk future `nixpkgs` bumps.  \\n\\nWe performed some necessary backports from `master` to re-enable the `release/10.5.x` branch for cluster benchmarking. As cluster maintenance has moved on and deviated over the months, we\'re now ready to swiftly benchmark a potential new `10.5` patch\\nrelease, should it see the light of day ([cardano-node PR#6421]).  \\n\\nWe also merged a large PR ([cardano-node PR#6380]) that brings many improvements to the performance workbench. We reworked the configuration of profiled builds (where the Haskell runtime itself profiles execution). There\\nis now full support for info-table profiling, and much more flexibility in configuring the runtime to write out an eventlog. Our automation now grants a long enough grace period to write out all profile data before Node processes are terminated.\\nThe PR also cleaned up the workbench\'s `nix` API, leading to more straightforward dependency resolution, a cleaner separation of concerns, removal of dead code, and an improved hit/miss ratio for cached binaries.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nEstablishing `trace-dipatcher` (the Node\'s new tracing system) as the default for `dmq-node` is nearly complete. We\'re currently performing a large refactoring with the goal to share code defining trace rendering between `cardano-node` and `dmq-node`;\\nthey do use the same `ouroboros-network` components after all. This will avoid redundant implementation, and ensure the same traces are emitted the same way by either application.\\n\\nWe\'ve ported a separate package in the Node project, `cardano-submit-api`, to use `trace-dispatcher` for logging and metrics - with nearly no changes to messages and metrics at the surface: [cardano-node PR#6326]. This removes the legacy tracing dependency\\nfrom the Submit API - a requirement to eventually retire the system from the Node as well. However, as legacy tracing is no longer supported, users are advised to adjust their configs accordingly starting with `cardano-submit-api-10.2`.  \\n\\nWe\'ve also merged a small PR ([cardano-node PR#6409]) that contains improvements to the new tracing system for both users and implementors. Most prominently, we\'ve adjusted default values and configs to prevent accidental misconfiguration\\nof the forwarding backend - which should make for a better user experience and adoption.\\n\\n### Node Diversity\\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve been working on building a comprehensive formal schema definition of all the Node\'s existing trace messages. The Haskell Node being the current reference implementation, it is a logical starting point. The goal is\\nto provide a fully compliant JSON schema so any tooling, or verification suite, can automatically derive parsers from it. Furthermore, it should be renderable into human-readable formal documentation. We believe this to be crucial\\nto enable unified trace semantics across diverse Node implementations; right now, we\'re still evaluating the most effective approach to maintain this over a long time, and guarantee consistency with the implementation.  \\n\\nLast but not least, we\'re building a proof-of-concept of how to implement our forwarding mini-protocol in Rust.

We\'ve also defined the full Ledger rules structure for Nested Transaction, albeit mostly with placeholder logic for now. Implementation for the logic in those rules is one of the main focus points for the upcoming weeks.\\n\\n* Started working on the first phase of [CIP-159 - Account Address Enhancement](https://github.com/fallen-icarus/CIPs/blob/account-enhancement/CIP-0159/README.md)\\n\\n  This is a very much anticipated CIP, because it will finally allow micropayments in ADA, once released with the Dijkstra era. We have so far defined one of the new fields in the transaction and performed some of the necessary code changes in preparation for this work.\\n\\n* Improvements on how CDDL specification is defined and how conformance testing against it is performed.\\n\\n  We had incredible progress on improving how CDDL is defined. We\'ve performed major refactoring of [`cuddle`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cuddle), which is the tool that we use for defining CDDL specification. We have designed a very nice interface for writing those definitions that drastically reduces duplication from era to era, thus improving safety of new definitions. Removal of a few bugs in the CDDL specification was a good testament to this effort. Moreover, we added the ability to supply custom value generators, which will allow us to test aspects of CDDL specification that were previously impossible to test due to the limited nature of CDDL expressiveness.\\n\\n  Furthermore, we just released a new tool [`antigen`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/antigen), which we are in process of integrating into `cuddle`, which once complete will let us write negative property tests for Ledger decoders. It might not sound like much, but it will in fact protect us from a whole class of deserialization bugs, such as one that happened on mainnet two months ago.\\n\\nBesides those major points above, since the last update, Ledger team:\\n* has gotten [CIP-0167 - Remove isValid from transactions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1089) accepted and fully implemented in Ledger.\\n* addressed quite a bit of technical dept and added further improvements to the Ledger testing framework.\\n\\n## Low level summary\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n* [PR-5458] -

While heap size increase is still present outside of our benchmarking environment, its extent there is negligible. We\'ve re-run cluster benchmarks to confirm the fix is successful.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve performed and analyzed benchmarks on several LSM-trees integration branches. This feature has as of now not been released in some Node version, so it is not yet fully configurable. The benchmarks have to be understood as a very\\nearly performance assessment. We\'ve performed benchmarks for both in-memory and on-disk backing stores. Especially for the on-disk benchmarks, we could observe RAM usage decreasing clearly, with only small increases in CPU usage. While there is some\\nextra cost to block adoption, cluster diffusion metrics still remain almost identical to the in-memory benchmarks - mostly due to header pipelining. As we didn\'t artificially constrain memory, the benchmarks are illustrative of LSM-trees behaviour\\nwhen there\'s no pressure from the garbage collector: Given that, will on-disk LSM-trees use caching / buffering efficiently, or will it perform redundant disk I/O? The answer is - the former.\\n\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nFor convenient creation of reporting documents, we\'re integrating a new typesetting tool: The brilliant, open-source [Typst] project promises fully typesettable and scriptable documents, while maintaining a syntax that is (almost) as easy to grasp\\nas Markdown. Typst extensions even render our gnuplots inline - and fast. Easily scriptable styling enables us to deliver an often requested feature: Colorizing individual result metrics based on how risky (or beneficial) a deviation from the\\nbaseline is deemed to be. Up to now, our reporting pipeline depended on Emacs Org mode and a medium-sized LaTeX distro as part of the Performance Workbench; we might be able to drop these heavy dependencies\\nin favor of something more modern soon.\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe Node\'s internal `PrometheusSimple` backend to expose metrics has received several robustness improvements. All those aim to mitigate factors in the host environment which can contribute to the backend becoming unreachable. It will now reap dangling socket\\nconnections more eagerly, preventing false positives in DoS protection. Furthermore, there now is a restart/retry wrapper in place, should the backend fail unexpectedly. All start and stop events are traced in the logs, exposing a potential error cause. \\nMerged in [cardano-node PR#6396].\\n\\nThe previous batch of quality-of-life improvements in [cardano-node PR#6377] has also been merged and released. It includes Prometheus HTTP service discovery for `cardano-tracer`, more robust recovering and tracing of forwarding connection interruptions as well as\\nstability improvements for engineers implementing tracers.\\n\\n### Leios\\n\\nOur conformance testing framework which evaluates linear temporal logic propositions against trace output has matured. It has seen some performance and usability improvements, for instance a helpful\\nhuman-readable output as to what minimal sequence of traces caused some proposition to be false - and the ability to consume traces from an arbitrary number of nodes instead of only one.

Some nodes accepted an invalid tx, while others rejected\\nit, leading to a fork of the chain.\\n\\nThe network team worked closely with the other Cadano teams, Intersect, Cardano\\nFoundation, Emurgo, and stake pool operators to monitor and resolve the\\nincident.\\n\\nThe network layer was not affected by the incident, and its resiliency played\\na role in the recovery of the network.  We identified some areas that can\\nfurther improve the network layer\'s robustness in such situations, and we\'ll be\\nworking on addressing these issues.\\n\\n### Churn Mitigation\\n\\nWe rolled out a churn mitigation included in the latest `cardano-node-10.5` and\\n`10.6` releases.  This change ensures the speed of churn of hot peers is at\\nleast the speed of churn for established peers, and the speed of churn of the\\nestablished peers is at least the speed of churn of known peers.   This way, we\\navoid a situation where, over a long period of time, established peers will\\naccumulate already tried hot peers, and cold peers will accumulate already\\ntried established peers.  See [#5238] for more details.\\n\\nThe issue was identified using [CF]\'s __[cardano-ignite]__ tool, with analysis\\nprovided by [Karl Knutsson].\\n\\n### DMQ-Node\\n\\nWe are initiating a public repository for `dmq-node` to host its codebase.\\n\\nWe removed the KES evolution configuration; as a consequence, the genesis file\\noption is no longer needed in the configuration of `dmq-node`, see [#5244].\\n\\n### Ouroboros Leios development\\n\\n#### Leios Demo\\n\\nWe have contributed improvements to consensus team\'s Leios demo, which includes minimal\\nprototypes of a few miniprotocols and a simple network emulation layer for exchanging data\\nbetween a leios server and patched cardano nodes. Our updates addressed unrealistic results obtained\\nstemming from the use of a program `toxiproxy` for modeling bandwidth and delays. We have also improved\\nour packet capture tooling and gathered some preliminary data for analysis. Based on this early\\ninvestigation, we have identified a few areas where non-trivial changes may have to be made to the network\\nstack to support the new protocol, as well as new features which could be introduced to deal with\\ngreatly expanded traffic requirements, while maintaining the base Praos protocol timeliness guarantees.\\nMore details about this were provided at the recent November Leios demo presentation, and further work\\nwill continue along these lines.\\n\\n#### Server-side re-ordering for a request-response mini-protocol\\n\\nIt is a requirement of Leios to support Frishest-First delivery.  For that\\npurpose we started to work on a prototype implementationof a request-response\\nmini-protocol which allows for server side re-ordering while maintaining\\n`typed-protocols` safety guarantees of deadlock & live-lock freedom.\\n\\n### Peer Selection Improvements\\n\\nRefined peer selection for local root peers behind firewalls: instead of\\npolling, it now waits for incoming connections and reuses them outbound.

Our benchmarks exhibited a clear increase in RAM usage (~15%) for a block producer. We\'re currently investigating the underlying cause, and whether it\'s reproducible outside of the benchmark,\\nwithout the constant, artificial stress we subject the system to. The published final results can be found in the [Performance report for 10.6.0-pre].\\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve performed compiler benchmarks for the Node built with `GHC9.12` instead of our current default `GHC9.6`. After getting both the `10.5` and the `10.6` branches to build with the new version, we performed cluster benchmarks for both, resulting\\nin a cross-comparison to their respective baselines. We could determine that the `GHC9.12` build is on par with the `GHC9.6` one for Node 10.5, and even slightly better for Node `10.6` as far as block production, diffusion and adoption metrics are concerned. However, it exhibits unexplained increases in CPU time used (~9%) and Allocations + Minor GCs (~6%). We also found that by disabling a particular optimization on `GHC9.12` called \'speculative evaluation of dictionary functions\', the increase in CPU time is roughly halved. So while the code base seems to be ready overall to switch to the more recent compiler version, that increase, though not dramatic, is still being investigated.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nOur prototype for aggregating timeseries of Node metrics, and evaluating `PromQL`-like queries on them, has made significant progress. The query language is nearly complete, and is evaluated with reasonable speed. Our current work focuses on an efficient\\nin-memory representation of timeseries - before considering any on-disk or database backed solution. To that end, we\'ve created a microbenchmark tracking space usage, and will use real-life scraped metrics data from nodes deployed and monitored by SRE.  \\n\\nThe clean separation of `cardano-tracer` into a library and an application part has entered testing. As it is built for highly concurrent operations, we chose a message-passing API where messages are always typed, and guaranteed to be consumed in the\\norder they were emitted. Custom applications will be able to implement handlers in a composable manner that react to certain message types (or values); at the same time, they can emit messages that won\'t interfere with the library\'s internal messaging - which is assured by Haskell\'s type system.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nWe\'ve simplified the `trace-forward` implementation (a non-breaking change). When forwarding traces, the host application buffers those objects in a bounded queue until they\'re requested. The implementation used to switch between queue sizes based on\\ncongestion, and to mitigate short, temporary service interruptions. After taking a look into the specifics of the queue implementation (in a dependency), we found that there\'s no overhead for the unused capacity of any queue - meaning switching the queue size\\nto the shorter variant does not yield any advantage. We were able to simplify the implementation based on that insight - which also turned out to be an optimization. Merged: [cardano-node PR#6361].\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe new tracing system is now the default since Node 10.6 (pre-)release. Based on SRE\'s internal deployments and feedback, we\'ve been adding several quality-of-life features as well as addressing some tech debt, as to enhance the new system\'s user experience.\\nThis includes a Prometheus HTTP service discovery feature for `cardano-tracer`, which allows for dynamically registering and scraping connected nodes, a CBOR formatting for trace messages which can be used to implement a binlog in the future (for space efficiency),\\nand a basic Haskell type with parser instances for machine-readable logs (JSON or CBOR), which greatly simplifies building any tooling that consumes trace output / log files.  \\n\\nAdditionally, there are many small changes that improve robustness, or code quality; such as safe garbage collection of threaded writers, simplification of the `LogFormatting` typeclass which is an interface of how traces can be rendered, properly tracing\\nforwarding service interruptions, and fixing delay increments in the retry policy for re-establishing a forwarding connection.  \\n\\nThe correspoding [cardano-node PR#6377] is currently in draft state.\\n\\n\\n### Leios\\n\\nWe\'re finalizing the Leios performance testing plan. This substantiates our approach based on the impact analysis, and formulates concrete steps regarding formal specification of system traces, generalisation of how benchmarking workloads are defined declaratively (and generated), taking advantage of common cases in performance and conformance testing (reducing the necessity for domain-specific tooling), and setting up dedicated microbenchmarks for key components (like e.g. crypto) which are designed to provide comparability over long time.\\n\\n\\n### Node diversity\\n\\nFor conformance testing across diverse node implementations, we\'ve designed a framework based on linear temporal logic (LTL). This allows for system or protocol properties to be expressed as logical propositions; it does not require\\nany executable specification or similar, and is thus language independent. Evaluation of LTL tends to be very fast and can potentially scale up to routine verifications as part of CI. Even though Haskell was chosen as a language for the project,\\nit can consume trace evidence from Cardano implementations in any language.  \\n\\nThe project [Cardano Trace LTL] is still in prototype stage; it\'s able to verify a few very basic Praos properties, expressed as LTL propositions, based on our benchmarking environment\'s trace evidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Performance report for 10.6.0-pre]: https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-11-performance-10.6.0-pre\\n[cardano-node PR#6361]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6361\\n[cardano-node PR#6377]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6377\\n[Cardano Trace LTL]: https://github.com/jutaro/cardano-trace-ltl"},{"id":"2025-11-21-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-11-21-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-11-21-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-21-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 21, 2025","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":3.14,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2025-11-21-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-11-25-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2025-11-19-ledger"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* Cardano-node `10.6.0` has been pre-released with the corresponding long\\nrunning SRE PRs now merged into this release!

This step puts it in the ready state for the final reviews. Once merged it will conclude the last point on the first milestone listed in the Nested Transaction proposal. Furthermore we have also implemented the distinction between sub-transactions and the top level transaction in such a way that will allow us reuse most of the existing Ledger functionality for transaction validation, regardless of the level.

Additionally, they advanced the design of certificate snarkification.\\n\\nFinally, they adapted the project to the latest NPM security changes for publishing packages and refactored the aggregator\'s HTTP client.\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n- Pre-released the new distribution [`2543.0-pre`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2543.0-pre)\\n- Completed the issue **Integrate the Haskell DMQ node in the e2e test** [#2674](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2674)\\n- Worked on the issue **Decentralization of configuration parameters - Phase 1** [#2692](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2692)\\n- Worked on the issue **Implement a simple aggregator discovery mechanism** [#2726](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2726)\\n- Worked on the issue **Release `2543` distribution** [#2727](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2727)\\n- Worked on the design of the snarkification of the certificates\\n\\n### Protocol maintenance\\n\\n- Worked on the issue **Implement a common aggregator client - Phase 1** [#2640](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2640)\\n- Worked on the issue **Enhance protocol security page on website** [#2703](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2703)\\n- Worked on the issue **Support NPM security changes with trusted publisher tokens** [#2745](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/2745)"},{"id":"2025-10-27-performance-and-tracing","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-10-27-performance-and-tracing","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-10-27-performance-and-tracing.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-27-performance-and-tracing.md","title":"Performance & Tracing Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2025-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 27, 2025","tags":[{"label":"performance-tracing","permalink":"/tags/performance-tracing"}],"readingTime":4.81,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Karg","title":"Performance and Tracing Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/mgmeier","imageURL":"https://github.com/mgmeier.png","key":"mgmeier"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","slug":"2025-10-27-performance-and-tracing","authors":"mgmeier","tags":["performance-tracing"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Mithril Team Update","permalink":"/2025-10-29-mithril"},"nextItem":{"title":"Network Team Update","permalink":"/2025-10-24-network"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\n* **Benchmarking**: Various maintenance to prepare for upcoming Node 10.6 changes; metrics migration guide for SPOs.\\n* **Development**: Prototyping a `PromQL`-based alert system for new tracing.\\n* **Infrastructure**: Located a space leak that was interfering with on-disk benchmarks.\\n* **Tracing**: Equipping `dmq-node` with the new tracing system; `cardano-tracer` library and API ongoing.\\n* **Leios**: Impact analysis and tech design; preparation for simulations hand-off.\\n* **Hydra**: Kick-off for development of system integration level benchmarks.\\n* **Node diversity**: Trace semantics specification ongoing; example test case ready for merging.\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nWe\'ve performed various maintenance tasks to accomodate our automation to several breaking changes that come with Node 10.6. There are new constraints on Plutus cost models in genesis files which make it more difficult\\nto set up a customized testnet, like our benchmarking cluster. Furthermore, we\'ve been assisting with integrating and debugging the upcoming release\'s components, such as tx validation in the `cardano-api`, or the implementation\\nof new trace messages the Node emits.  \\n\\nAs the new tracing system will be the default on Node 10.6, we\'ve created a tool which, given a side-by-side listing of metrics names from both systems, will automatically generate an exhaustive migration guide for SPOs. As the metrics names have changed slightly,\\na migration for existing monitoring setups is required as a one-off effort. The migration guide will be published on the [Cardano Developer Portal].  \\n\\nWhilst the legacy tracing system is still fully operational in Node 10.6, the release marks the begin of its deprecation period - giving SPOs sufficient time to adjust their setups.\\n\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWhile `cardano-tracer` logs forwarded trace messages according to detailed configs, and exposes forwarded metrics, it does not provide any built-in functionality for monitoring and alerts. The experimental `RTView` component, which still can be built for `cardano-tracer` and remains fully functional, was an attempt to provide dashboards and alerts out of the box. However, due to its restricted design and low interoperability with existing monitoring standards, it has been discontinued.  \\n\\nCurrently, we\'re taking another stab at this: We\'re building a prototype that creates timeseries directly from observed metrics, and is able to parse and evaluate [PromQL] queries referring to them. Based on that prototype, we\'ll assess resource usage and feasibility of fully building\\nthat feature into `cardano-tracer`. As most monitoring alerts can be (and are) defined as conditions on `PromQL` query results, and `PromQL` is an established industry standard, we see a low barrier for adaptation. Furthermore, if built sufficiently modular, it would eliminate the need to operate additional 3rd party services for scraping metrics and monitoring for alert conditions - at least in some usage scenarios.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nWith help and support from the Consensus team (Gracias, Javier!), we were able to locate a space leak that affected on-disk benchmarks. While the current on-disk benchmarks are representative, the space leak prevented us from scaling memory limits for the Node process with finer granularity.\\nThis will get merged post 10.6 release, and will be of much use when we do comparative benchmarks of the LMDB and the new `lsm-trees` on-disk backing stores.\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nWe\'ve been working on equipping the Network team\'s new `dmq-node` service with our new tracing system, `trace-dispatcher` - still a work in progress. Currently, the `dmq-node` uses plain contravariant tracing. Having a configurable system, with an API abstraction to define metadata and message serializations as well as process metrics, is a necessary step towards production-ready tracing. The added benefit of using `trace-dispatcher` is reusability of definitions already implemented in `cardano-node`, and a uniform way of how\\n`cardano-node` and `dmq-node` are configured, as well as how the expose trace evidence and metrics.  \\n\\nThe work on `cardano-tracer` as a library, with principled API and intra-process communications, is ongoing. Implementation is almost complete, and will enter testing phase soon.\\n\\n\\n### Leios\\n\\nWe\'ve contributed to [Leios Impact Analysis]. The Performance & Tracing section summarizes how implementing, and eventually benchmarking Leios will impact various aspects of our approach. This spans from adding new Leios-specific observables into component code, to deriving\\nsubmission workloads suitable for Leios, to finding a scaling approach to be able to correlate performance observations to exact changes in Leios protocol parameters.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'re currently working on the Leios technical design and implementation plan, which lays out our approach and derives some very high-level steps on how to realize it, based on the impact analysis.\\n\\n### Hydra\\n\\nWe\'ve kicked off a collaboration with the Hydra team. The goal is to build system integration level benchmarks for Hydra, which can target system pressure points, and which are able to scale operations in various directions - much akin to what we\'re doing for\\nthe Cardano node. Eventually, those benchmarks should provide more than just immediate feedback for Hydra engineers; they should be able to yield realistic figures of what to expect from operating one (or more) Hydra heads, and what the resource requirements are to achieve that.\\nCurrently, we\'re familiarizing ourselves with the system and its built-in observability to assess if it meets the requirements for the benchmarks we have in mind.\\n\\n### Node diversity\\n\\nThe work on (multi-)node conformance testing is ongoing. We\'re in the process of creating a specification document for semantics of existing Node traces. While a few of them might be unique to the Haskell implementation, the majority documents how\\nCardano itself runs and behaves; those traces can implemented accordingly across diverse Node projects.  \\n\\nOur own demonstration test case for conformance testing is fully implemented and ready to be merged after the Node 10.6 release. It validates a metric exposed by a node wrt. trace evidence in its logs and internal events the metric is based on; see [cardano-node PR#6322].\\n\\n\\n\\n[Cardano Developer Portal]: https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool\\n[cardano-node PR#6322]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6322\\n[Leios Impact Analysis]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/ImpactAnalysis.md\\n[PromQL]: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics"},{"id":"2025-10-24-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-10-24-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-10-24-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-24-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"Overview of sprint 98 and 99","date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 24, 2025","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/tags/network"}],"readingTime":1.585,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2025-10-24-network","authors":["coot"],"tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-10-27-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"SRE Team Update","permalink":"/2025-10-24-sre"}},"content":"## Overview of sprint [98][sprint-98] and [99][sprint-99]\\n\\n### Cardano-Node 10.6 Release\\n\\nWe swiftly identified and resolved an issue in the\\n`Ouroboros.Network.Server.Simple.with` function.

It\'s designed to reduce redundant exchange of transactions between network nodes. To that end we\'ve created a dedicated benchmark\\nwhich is able to locally reproduce performance observations on the cloud cluster - and hence be executed with GHC profiling for tracking time and space usage.  \\n\\nThe on-disk (`LMDB`) benchmarks for the cluster have been generalized into full-fledged benchmarking profiles that can be scaled for available RAM (and thus the pressure on the on-disk backing store to perform disk I/O) - and be applied\\nto other backing store implementations as well. This will allow for direct performance comparisons with the `lsm-trees` solution, once it is integrated into the Node.\\n\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nThere\'s a microservice, `cardano-submit-api`, which is run independently from the Node (if desired). It allows for Cardano transactions to be submitted via HTTP POST, instead of Cardano native protocols. It\'s still using\\nthe legacy tracing system, which is why we\'re currently porting its logging and metrics to the new one.  \\n\\nWe\'re also laying groundwork for (multi-)node conformance testing. This entails creating a specification document for semantics of existing traces. These traces can then be emitted accordingly across diverse node implementations. Given the unified semantics,\\nthese points of evidence can then be evaluated against each other, against our Haskell reference implementation, or against a model of specified / expected behaviour, resulting in a quantifiable way to assess conformance across individual implementations.\\nCurrently, we\'re implementing a playground version of this in the tracing system\'s own test suite, where we assess whether the metrics a node exposes conforms to the trace evidence in its logs, and to the metrics it forwards to `cardano-tracer`.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nAs a maintenance task, we\'re integrating the new Dijkstra ledger era into our performance workbench and all benchmarking tools. This will allow us to specify existing profiles in the new era (allowing us to comparatively benchmark its implementation against previous eras)\\nas well as create new benchmarks making use of any Dijkstra-specific feature.\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe trace consuming / processing service `cardano-tracer` had been built as a monolithic application. We\'re currently redesigning it as a more modular one, splitting it up into a library and an application proper (which hosts all its current high-level functionality).\\nThe underlying library will be equipped with an API that meets community standards in the future. For now, we\'re focusing on making all library components safely restartable and reconfigurable, as well as providing abstract, clean intra-process communications (`cardano-tracer` is a highly multi-threaded app). These capabilities are also verified in the test suite.  \\n\\nThis will facilitate rapid development of custom, specialized applications for trace consumption and processing: The library package will provide all mid-level abstractions, as well as the Cardano native multiplexed forwarding protocol. It will allow any application\\nto focus exclusively on implementing the high-level features it aims to.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Team\\n\\nRuslan joined Performance & Tracing as a Software Engineer. He has a ton of functional programming experience under his belt, in Idris, in Haskell and in Scala. Additionally, he used to work as a perfomance engineer for a large, distributed commercial system.

This involves implementing the necessary logic to handle and verify\\nsignatures, ensuring that the node can correctly process Mithril-related data.\\nProgress is being tracked in [issue#5175] and [issue#5176].\\n\\n### Cardano-Node\\n\\nWe worked on configuration and tracing improvements for the upcoming\\n`cardano-node` 10.6 release. The focus was on enhancing the user experience in\\n`Genesis` and `Praos` modes by refining how the network topology file is handled.\\nSpecifically, we addressed issues where the topology file contains bootstrap\\npeers and genesis snapshot file locations, which are only relevant in one of the\\nmodes. The goal is to ensure that parsing errors are minimised and that appropriate\\nlog messages are emitted instead of errors in specific scenarios. Detailed\\ncorner cases are documented in [issue#6304].\\n\\n### Tx-Submission\\n\\nWe wrote a microbenchmark to evaluate the performance of the new tx-submission\\ndecision logic.  The results will help identify any performance bottlenecks and\\nguide further optimisations. See [pr#5191].\\n\\n### Chain-Sync Protocol Specification Update\\n\\nThe specification of the chain-sync mini-protocol has been relaxed to reflect\\nthe `Cardano-Node` implementation more accurately.  The changes include\\nallowing the server to send `MsgRollBackward` after sending `MsgFindIntersect`\\nallowing the rollback to a point before the found intersection point.  See\\n[pr#5187].\\n\\n### Disconnection Reason Propagation\\n\\nAfter a discussion in the networking working group, we found out that we\\ncould improve the debugging experience for SPOs by propagating the disconnection\\nreason from the low-level connection manager to the inbound / outbound governor.  This\\nwill allow SPOs to understand better why a connection was dropped.  The work is\\ntracked in [pr#5189].\\n\\n### QuickCheck-2.15 and 2.16\\n\\nWe relaxed the bounds of `QuickCheck` dependency for the upcoming\\n`cardano-node-10.6` release for a smoother transition,

performance optimizations and refactoring for the Plutus evaluator and deserializer, including [#7272](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/pull/7272), [#7281](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/pull/7281), [#7286](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/pull/7286), [#7287](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/pull/7287), and [#7296](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/pull/7296).\\n\\n- We added support for built-in units and pairs.\\n  This functionality will be enabled at the upcoming intra-era hard fork.\\n\\n- We continued developing the [UPLC-CAPE benchmark](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/UPLC-CAPE), aimed to compare the performances of different surface languages targeting UPLC.\\n  A presentation on this was given in the Plutus working group meeting on September 2nd, 2025.\\n\\n### Plinth\\n\\n- We added a Plinth library function, [`caseInteger`](https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/master/plutus-tx/PlutusTx-Builtins-Internal.html#v:caseInteger) that compiles to casing on integers in UPLC, a feature that will be enabled at the upcoming intra-era hard fork.\\n\\n- We made the compilation fail early with a better error message when an unsupported Haskell language extension is used.\\n\\n- We added more source code location information to Plinth compiler\'s compilaton trace (which can be obtained using the `dump-compilation-trace` flag), and the error message when the compilation fails.\\n\\n## Low level

LMDB (UTxOs on-disk) benchmarks.\\n* **Development**: New memory-constrained benchmark families, targeting UTxOs on-disk.\\n* **Infrastructure**: Migration of bench cluster completed.\\n* **Tracing**: Deprecation of legacy system; TCP forwarding merged; improved self-documentation.\\n* **Meetup**: Performance & Tracing meetup held in Cardiff, Wales.\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nWe\'ve performed and analysed release benchmarks for Node `10.5`. The pre-release turned on peer sharing by default; our benchmarks indicated a negative performance impact when enabling this on block producers. The current release `10.5.1` does not enable peer sharing\\nfor block producers; the published final results can be found in the [Performance report for 10.5].  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve achieved meaningful benchmarks for UTxOs-on-disk, which use the LMDB backend. Our new profiles support seamless scaling of RAM pressure on the backend, forcing disk I/O to a varying degree. We\'re currently analysing the observations made, and\\ngathering more data using different scaling factors if needed; the goal is a reliable assessmemt of LMDB\'s viability for block producing nodes.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nDeveloping RAM-constrained benchmarks that would put tunable pressure on an UTxOs-on-disk backend posed a unique challenge.  \\n\\nFirst and foremost, limiting memory for past in-memory benchmarks has never been a requirement at all. A consistent approach to do so given the existing deployment had to be built, along with pertinent diagnostic tooling. Second, the LMDB backend\\nis not managed by Haskell\'s GHC runtime, but comes with its own memory management - which required us to develop a double-pronged approach to selectively apply RAM limits. Lastly, other parts of the Node\'s code didn\'t support executing in tightly limited, constant\\nspace and would lead to the OS terminating the Node for running out of memory.  \\n\\nThe interaction of various `cgroup` limits on Linux kernels, memory settings in our Nomad deployment and GHC RTS options let us create a stable runtime behavior over the course of the benchmark - a hard requirement, as system metrics taken at the\\nbeginning of a run must be comparable to those towards the end. A blocker for initializing the Node for benchmarks was resolved in [cardano-node PR#6295]: Using `mmap` allowed us to use the OS\'s virtual memory subsystem for on-demand loading instead of it being\\nmanaged by the Haskell runtime - which significantly brought down the heap size required for the task.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe migration to the new benchmarking cluster is finalized. For representative performance measurements of UTxOs-on-disk, we require direct SSD storage on each cloud machine instance. Along with deploying the new hardware came a full upgrade of OS and `nixpgks` software.\\nValidating the migration was extra effort: A seemingly innocent cloud provider service (which was newly added to their `NixOS` image) did nothing more than a heartbeat request every 5 min to some central infrastructure server. Yet, it caused the\\nstandard deviation of some of our network related metrics to double - thus reducing confidence in those metrics.  \\n\\nAfter validation, we performed a complete re-run of existing performance baselines on the new hardware.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nWork on the new tracing system has yielded various improvements. Trace forwarding over TCP is now fully functional and merged to `master`. This will make setting up forwarding to remote hosts much easier than by using UNIX domain sockets / Windows named pipes.\\nHowever, it\'s recommended for secure and isolated environments only ([cardano-node PR#6241]).  \\n\\nThe auto-documentation feature of the new system has improved user experience; the generated documents are now structed in a more accessible way, and contain necessary metadata as to which Node version / commit is being documented by them ([cardano-node PR#6283]).  \\n\\nAnother refactoring targeted the new system\'s core library, `trace-dispatcher`. It now comes with a minimal dependency footprint and fully equipped with all necessary type definitions to be built using Haskell\'s community packages (Hackage) exclusively. This greatly\\nenhances the ease to use it for other applications than the Node as well - Cardano or non-Cardano ([cardano-node PR#6268]). Increasing the dependency footprint is only required for additional features, like trace forwarding.  \\n\\nWith the upcoming Node `10.6` release, we plan to officially deprecate the legacy tracing system. This means it will enter a grace period of ~3 months, where both systems coexist in the same Node build; then, it will be decommissioned and actively removed from the code base.\\n\\n### Meetup\\n\\nWe organized 2025\'s in-person team meetup in Cardiff, Wales. We had highly insightful and productive days - I would like to thank all team members who contributed, and extend my special thanks to guests from outside of the team: Your \\npresence and contributions were greatly appreciated, Can Huzmeli and Neil Davies.\\n\\n\\n[Performance report for 10.5]: https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-07-performance-10.5.0\\n[cardano-node PR#6295]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6295\\n[cardano-node PR#6241]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6241\\n[cardano-node PR#6283]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6283\\n[cardano-node PR#6268]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6268"},{"id":"2025-08-07-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-08-07-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-08-07-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-07-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High-level summary","date":"2025-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 7, 2025","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":1.495,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Noon van der Silk","title":"Software Engineering Lead","url":"https://github.com/noonio","imageURL":"https://github.com/noonio.png","key":"noonio"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2025-08-07-hydra","authors":["noonio"],"tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-08-08-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2025-08-06-consensus"}},"content":"### High-level summary\\n\\nWe have been extremely busy these last few weeks supporting the glacier drop.\\nWe continue to focus on this, as well as starting to make some broader\\nchanges.\\n\\n### What did the team achieve?\\n\\n* Released several patch versions;

More importantly this refactoring made accounts more extensible and will in future facilitate new features like: changes needed for Leios, full Chimeric Ledger through promotion of reward accounts to proper accounts, as well as ability to store multi-assets in the Treasury and submitting TreasuryWithdrawals governance actions that withdraw other assets except ADA.\\n\\nFurthe more, we progressed with some features for the next intra-era hard fork as well as for the next Dijkstra era. We\'ve implemented a long asked feature to report the pre-image of the script integrity hash upon validation failures, which will improve user experience and is planned to become available upon the next intra-era hardfork. With respect to Dijkstra implementation we\'ve added new protocol parameters for values that ended up being hard coded in the Conway era.

Cardano-Node changes\\n\\nThe default value for `PeerSharing` configuration option in\\n`cardano-node-10.5.1` will be:\\n* `false` if the node is configured as a block producer\\n* `true` if the node is configured as a relay\\n\\nSee [PR#6284], [PR#6274].\\n\\nWe also deprecated `cardano-node run` command line flag `--non-producing-node`\\nin favour of `--start-as-non-producing-node`.\\n\\n### Chain-Sync\\n\\nWe modified `chain-sync` timeout implementation.  The idle timeout will be\\nchosen randomly each time `chain-sync` mini-protocol enters `StIdle` state,\\nwhile before the timeout was fixed during connection lifetime (although it was\\nstill random).  This was done to eliminate survivor bias, where long-lived\\nconnections were those which had longer timeouts.  Now it should be fairer\\nfor all connections.\\n\\nNote that this timeout will be triggered due to a suffciently large gap between\\nconsecutive blocks, as a result of Cardano\'s probabilistic schedule.\\n\\nSee [PR#4980].\\n\\n### SRV support according to [CIP#155]\\n\\nWe merged SRV support according to [CIP#155], see [PR#5131].\\n\\n### PeerSharing in InitiatorOnlyMode\\n\\nWe made it possible to configure `PeerSharing` on connections which negotiated\\n`InitiatorOnlyDiffusionMode`.

Both features have shown a positive performance impact; the former\\nimproves CPU usage and block production metrics, the latter slightly improves diffusion metrics.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nHaving finalized and benchmarked the periodic ledger metrics tracer feature, it was merged to `master` and will be part of the upcoming `10.5` release. The feature decorrelates obtaining several metrics from the beginning of the forging loop.\\nThis avoids competition for synchronization primitives during the \\"hot phase\\" of block production. Furthermore, by decoupling those metrics from a forging tracer, we enable exposing those metrics from a relay as well. [cardano-node PR#6180]\\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve been vital in creating two hotfixes for the old tracing system: \\n1. The old tracing system metric `utxoSize` was missing due to using the pre-UTxO-HD variant of querying the set size. The fix ports the correct solution from the new tracing system to the old one: [cardano-node PR#6217]\\n2. On the upcoming Node `10.5` integration branch only, the old tracing system could leak file descriptors. Again, the fix was ported from the new tracing system to the old one - kudos to Karl Knutsson: [iohk-monitoring PR#654]\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nWe\'ve discussed and set up a migration plan for our benchmarking cluster hardware. For fair and representative performance measurements of on-disk backing stores of UTxO-HD, we require direct SSD storage on the machine instance in the cloud; running\\ndisk I/O through additional layers to and from some shared SSD device, even in the same data center, would introduce significant confounding factors. The plan includes invalidating as little of our existing performance baselines as possible when\\nmigrating to the new hardware. We\'re looking forward to benchmark the current on-disk backend (LMDB) for block producers - as well as the futuere LSM-tree based one.  \\n\\nWe\'ve also discussed an initial Leios impact analysis. To fairly and reliably benchmark a future Leios implementation, our infrastructure and tooling will need to be extended significantly. Several metrics won\'t have the same\\nweight they currently carry for Praos, due to Leios\' later finality; other metrics will need to be introduced for different new Leios block types, adding appropriate observability to the implementation. Finally, creating and submitting a saturation workload for a system which is built for extremely high throughput will be a challenge in itself.\\n\\n### New Tracing\\n\\nWe\'ve been working on a medium-sized refactoring that eliminates the `cardano-node` dependency from `cardano-tracer`. This means, the tracer service can now be built independently of the Node; all shared data types have been moved\\nto some more basic packages of the new tracing system. This also enables us to issue releases of the tracer service *independently* of the Node\'s release cycle. [cardano-node PR#6125]  \\n\\nLast not least, we\'ve kicked off development for a new feature that\'s been motivated by community feedback: Forwarding observables (trace messages, metrics) over TCP. Forwarding to different hosts currently assumes a UNIX domain socket that connects the Node and\\nthe tracer service through an SSH tunnel. This is a portable, versatile, and probably one of the most secure ways to transmit sensitive data. However, in an environment where an operator controls all network port mapping and firewalls, one can\\nargue that forwarding over TCP/IP is equally viable, as it can be properly isolated - and it is much more convenient to set up and configure. The feature aims, when it\'s completed, to offer both forwarding routes, and let the end user decide.\\n\\n\\n[cardano-node PR#6180]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6180\\n[cardano-node PR#6217]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6217\\n[iohk-monitoring PR#654]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-monitoring-framework/pull/654\\n[cardano-node PR#6125]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/6125"},{"id":"2025-05-23-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-05-23-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-05-23-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-23-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2025-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 23, 2025","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.875,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2025-05-23-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-05-26-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2025-05-21-ledger"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* Cardano-node and cardano-cli release versions are now set to `10.4.1` and\\n`10.8.0.0`, respectively, in cardano-parts release `v2025-05-22`.\\n\\n* The upcoming node `10.5` \\\\[pre-]release is being configured to use genesis\\nmode by default on preview and preprod environments.\\n\\n* SRE is collaborating with IT Sec team to further harden our infra and\\nclusters.\\n\\n\\n## Repository Work -- Merged\\n\\n### Cardano-parts\\n* Sets node release to `10.4.1`, cardano-cli release to `10.8.0.0` and mithril to\\n  `v2517.1`.

It is the first mainline release of an UTxO-HD node featuring `LedgerDB`. Leading up to the release, we previously performed and analysed UTxO-HD benchmarks. We were\\nable to document a regression in RAM usage, and assisted in pinpointing its origin, leading to it being fixed swiftly for the `10.4` release.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we ran feature benchmarks for a potential socket I/O optimization in the network layer, and GC setting changes catering to the now-default GHC9.6 compiler. Both benchmarks have shown moderate improvements in various performance metrics.\\nThis might enable the network team to pick up the optimization for `10.5`. Also, we might be able to update the recommended GC settings for block producers, and add them to our own nix service configs for deployment.  \\n\\nThe `10.4.1` performance report has been published on [Cardano Updates].\\n\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWe\'ve further evolved the (still experimental) quick query feature of our analysis tool `locli`. Parametrizable quick queries allow for arbitrary queries into raw benchmarking data, uncovering correlations not part of standard analysis. They are implemented using composable definitions inside a filter-reduce framework. With `locli`\'s DB storage backend, we can leverage the DB engine to do much of the work. Now, we\'re integrating a precursor to quick queries - so called trace queries - into the framework. Those can process raw trace\\ndata from archived log files. Currently, we\'re adding an abstraction layer such that it is opaque to the framework whether the data was retrieved (and possibly pre-processed) from a DB or from raw traces.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we added a custom (CBOR-based) serialization for intermediate results so a query can be evaluated on a remote machine - like the system archiving all benchmarking runs - but triggered, and its results visualized, on your localhost.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe workbench nix code optimization has finally been merged. Redundant derivations and recursions have been replaced; many nix store entries have been consolidated. Among other things, the new code also aims to maximize nix cache hits. Furthermore,\\nas GHC8.10 has now been officially retired from all build pipelines, we were able to clean up all tech debt in our automations that we had to keep around due to supporting the old compiler version.  \\n\\nExactly as we had hoped, this has brought down CI time for the Node by orders of magnitude; first, from over an hour to around 15 min, then to under 10 min. Also, all workbench shell invocations are significantly faster, and clutter in the nix store\\nis greatly reduced.\\n\\n### New Tracing\\n\\nWe\'ve been hurrying to provide hotfixes for `connectionManager_*` and `slotsMissed` metrics that were faulty on Node `10.3`.

Having taken previous measurements on the release integration branch, we expect the results to be closely aligned with these.  \\n\\nNode `10.3.1` will support two compiler versions, namely GHC8.10.7 and GHC9.6.5. As a consequence, we benchmark both Node builds and compare against the previous performance baseline `10.2`. So far, the release benchmarks confirm\\nperformance improvements in both resource usage and block production metrics seen on the integration branch - for both compiler versions. A final report will be published on [Cardano Updates].\\n\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nThe first version of our new tool `calibrate-script` is about to be merged. It is part of the `tx-generator` project, and calibrates Plutus benchmarking scripts according to a range of constraints on the expected workload. The tool\\ndocuments the result and all intermediate steps in a developer-friendly way. A CSV report is generated which shows all properties of some calibration at a glance: How much execution budget was given, and how much of each execution budget was used,\\nwas memory or CPU steps the limiting factor for the script, how large will the resulting transaction be and what will it cost and more. Apart from greatly speeding up development of Plutus benchmarks for our team, this tool can also be used to assess\\nchanges to Plutus cost models, or efficiency of different Plutus compiler outputs - without running a full benchmark.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the benchmarking profiles defined in `cardano-profile` have undergone a large maintenance cycle. Besides a cleanup, several profiles were fixed wrt. transaction fees or duration, others now run on a more appropriate performance baseline. \\nThere era-dependency of a profile requiring a minimum protocol version has been solved such that it\'s now impossible to construct incompatible profiles by definition - e.g. a `PlutusV3` benchmark in any era prior to Conway. The correspondig PR is about to be merged\\nshortly.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nA large PR simplifying the build of our performance workbench has been finalized and passed testing. The nix code has been greatly optimized to avoid redundant derivations and creating an abundance of nix store paths. This not only makes the workbench\\nbetter maintainable, it greatly reduces time and size requirements for CI jobs. In testing, we could observe a speedup of 40% - 50% for CI. Additionally, this PR prepares for the future removal of GHC8.10 as a release compiler - which will reduce CI\\ncost even more. The PR is currently under review and to be merged soon.\\n\\n\\n### New Tracing\\n\\nThe work on untangling dependencies in the new tracing system has entered testing phase. The `cardano-tracer` service no longer depends on the Node - with common data types and typeclass instances having been refactored to a more basic package of the\\ntracing system. Once merged, this will allow for the service to be built, released and operated independently of `cardano-node`, widening its range of use cases.  \\n\\nOn Node 10.1, we\'ve built a prototype of the \'Periodic tracer\' feature. It decorrelates tracing ledger metrics from the start of a block producer\'s forging loop, thus removing competition on certain synchronization primitives. We\'ve already shown\\nin past benchmarks it had a positive impact on block production performance. This prototype is now being developed for production release, complete with configuration options, and we aim to land it in Node 10.4.\\n\\n### Node Diversity\\n\\nWe\'ve contributed to the recent Conformance Testing workshop in Paris. The topic was how to approach detection and documentation of system behaviour across diverse Cardano Node implementations: Where is the behaviour conforming to some blueprint, where\\ndoes it deviate - intentionally or accidentally. Our tracing system is the prime provider of observability - and all evidence of program execution could in theory be checked against a machine-readable model of the blueprint. This of course assumes\\nobservables are implemented uniformly across diverse Node projects, i.e. without changing semantics. Thankfully, our tracing system lead engineer J\xfcrgen Nicklisch was able to join that workshop and add to the discussions around that approach.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Cardano Updates]: https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports"},{"id":"2025-04-11-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-04-11-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-04-11-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-11-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2025-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 11, 2025","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":2.03,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2025-04-11-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-04-15-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2025-04-09-ledger"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* Cardano-node, cardano-cli, and db-sync versions are now set to `10.2.1` and\\n`10.4.0.0`, `13.6.0.5`, respectively, in cardano-parts release `v2025-04-03`.\\n\\n* The [blockfrost-platform](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform)\\nis now in capkgs and cardano-parts default devShell, pkgs and cluster\\nflakeModules.\\n\\n* `ConsensusMode` cardano-node configuration and supporting files were added to\\nthe baseline node configurations in iohk-nix and integrated into cardano-node for\\nthe `10.3.x` \\\\[pre-]release.

This was an especially necessary task to handle for the upcoming work on [Nested Transactions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/862)\\n* We finished adjusting the representation of `CertState`, which is the part of the ledger state responsible for managing the state of entities that are manipulated with transaction certificates. This representation now more accurately reflects the difference between pre vs post-Conway eras.\\n* We did a minor performance improvement of transaction size calculation\\n* Improved the `MemoBytes` interface to disallow unsafe construction and improved the consistency of transaction related modules.\\n* Did `AccountState` type rename as preparation for potential promotion of reward accounts to full blown accounts, which might be needed for Leios later down the road.\\n\\nWe\'ve also accomplished a very nice simplification to our constraint based generation framework. Fixed our example Plutus scripts that we use for testing. Got rid of a couple of redundant Byron test packages, which were causing rebuilds of the same code twice and caused unnecessary maintenance overhead. Besides that we also did some other minor quality of life improvements to the Ledger codebase.\\n\\n## Low level summary\\n\\n### Features\\n* [pull-4914] - Add `ConwayCertState`\\n* [pull-4959] - Improve performance of sizeTxF\\n* [pull-4971] - Rename `AccountState` to `ChainAccountState`\\n* [pull-4973] - Make `MemoBytes` interface safe\\n* [pull-4968] - Move annotator to testlib\\n\\n### Testing\\n\\n* [pull-4954] - Add `expectTxSuccess` to `ShelleyEraImp` and use it in `trySubmitTx`\\n* [pull-4958] - Update spec&#39;s code location\\n* [pull-4921] - Refactor the constrained generators to get rid of the Fn stuff\\n* [pull-4972] - Fix and bump cardano-ledger-executable-spec\\n* [pull-4923] - Update V3 scripts in plutus-preprocessor to use the new `Data` api\\n\\n### Infrastructure and releasing\\n\\n* [pull-4956] - Convert byron test packages to sublibraries\\n* [pull-4957] - Add script for bumping CHANGELOGS post-release\\n* [pull-4965] - Expose Byron CDDLs in `Test.Cardano.Chain.Binary.Cddl`\\n\\n[pull-4954]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4954\\n[pull-4914]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4914\\n[pull-4958]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4958\\n[pull-4956]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4956\\n[pull-4957]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4957\\n[pull-4965]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4965\\n[pull-4959]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4959\\n[pull-4921]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4921\\n[pull-4972]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4972\\n[pull-4971]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4971\\n[pull-4973]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4973\\n[pull-4968]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4968\\n[pull-4923]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/pull/4923"},{"id":"2025-04-09-mithril","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-04-09-mithril","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-04-09-mithril.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-09-mithril.md","title":"Mithril Team Update","description":"High level overview","date":"2025-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 9, 2025","tags":[{"label":"mithril","permalink":"/tags/mithril"}],"readingTime":0.825,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Philippe Raynaud","title":"Mithril Tech Lead","url":"https://github.com/jpraynaud","imageURL":"https://github.com/jpraynaud.png","key":"jpraynaud"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Mithril Team Update","slug":"2025-04-09-mithril","authors":"jpraynaud","tags":["mithril"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2025-04-09-ledger"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2025-04-02-consensus"}},"content":"## High level overview\\n\\nThis week, some members of the Mithril team attended a workshop on the Cardano node diversity in Paris.\\n\\nThey continued adapting the infrastructure to support the aggregator\u2019s prototype \u2018follower\u2019 mode and focused on signing ancillary files in the Cardano database snapshots with an IOG key.

Benchmarking the earliest version of the `10.3` integration branch, we could already\\ndetermine that the effort put in has yielded promising results and confirm improvements in both resource usage and block production metrics. A regular release benchmark will be performed, and published, from the final\\nrelease tag.  \\n\\n#####  Compiler versions: `GHC9.6.5` vs. `GHC8.10.7`\\n\\nSo far, code generation with `GHC9.6` has resulted in a performance regression for block production under heavy load - we\'ve established that in various past benchmarks. The optimization efforts on `10.3` also\\nfocused on removing that performance blocker. Benchmarking the integration branch with the newer compiler version has now confirmed it has not only vanished; moreover, code generated with `GHC9.6` \\neven exhibited slightly more favourable performance characteristics. So in all likelihood, Node `10.3` will be the last release to support `GHC8.10`, and we will recommend `GHC9.6` as the default build platform for it.\\n\\n##### Plutus budget scaling\\n\\nWe\'ve repeated several Plutus budget scaling benchmarks on Node version `10.3` / `GHC9.6`. By scaling execution budgets to 1.5x and 2x their current mainnet values, we can determine the performance impact on the\\nnetwork of potential increases of said budgets. We independently measured bumping the steps (CPU) limit with a CPU-intensive script, and bumping the memory limit with a script performing lots of allocations. We could\\nobserve the performance impact to correspond linearly with the limit bump in each case. This gives certainty and predictability of the impact when suggesting changes to mainnet protocol parameters.  \\n\\nOur team presented those findings and the data to the Parameter Comittee for discussion.\\n\\n\\n##### Runtime system (RTS) settings \\n\\nThe recommended RTS settings for `cardano-node` encompass number of CPU cores to use, behaviour of the allocator, and behaviour of the garbage collector. The recommended settings so far are tuned to `GHC8.10`\'s RTS - one\\ncannot assume the same settings are optimal for `GHC9.6`\'s RTS, too. So we\'ve started a series of short, exploratory benchmarks comparing a matrix of promising changes to update our recommendation in the future.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWe\'ve started to develop a new tool that calibrates our Plutus benchmarking scripts given a range of constraints on the expected workload. These entail exhausting a certain budget (block or transaction), or calibrating\\nfor a constant number of transactions per block while exhausting available steps, or memory, budget(s). The result of that directly serves as input to our benchmarking profile definition. This tool may also be of wider interest, as it\\nallows for modifying various inputs, such as Plutus cost models, or script serializations generated by different compilers or compiler versions. That way, one can compare at a glance how effective a given script makes\\nuse of the available budgets, given a specific cost model.  \\n\\nAdditonally, our benchmarking profiles are currently undergoing a maintenance cycle. This means, setups for which motivation has ceased to exist are removed, several are updated to use the Voltaire performance baseline, others\\nneed to be tested for their conformity with the Plomin hard-fork protocol updates.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe extensive work of simplifying the performance workbench is almost finished and about to enter testing phase. We have been moving away from scripting to declarative (Haskell) definitions of all benchmark profiles and workloads in\\npast PRs. The simplification work now reaps the benefits of that: We can optimize away many recursive / redundant invocations or nix evaluations, we can collate many nix store paths into just a couple ones, reduce the workbench\'s\\noverall closure size and complexity. Apart from saving significant resources and time for CI runners, this will reduce maintence effort necessary on our end.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve done maintenance on our tooling by adjusting to the latest changes in `cardano-api`. This included porting the `ProtocolParameters` type and type class instances over to us, as our use case requires\\nwe continue supporting it. However, it\'s considered deprecated in the API, and so this unblocks the team for eventually removing it.\\n\\n### New Tracing\\n\\nHaving addressed all feature and change requests relevant for the Node 10.3 release, we performed thorough mainnet testing of the new system\'s metrics in a monitoring context. We relied on the extremely diligent and helpful\\nfeedback from the SRE team. This enabled us to iron out a couple of remaining inconsistencies - a big shout-out and thank you to John Lotoski.  \\n\\nAdditionally, again with SRE, a nix service configuration (SVC) has been created for `cardano-tracer` that was generalized and aligned in structure with the existing `cardano-node` SVC. It was evolved from the existing\\nSVC in our performance workbench, which however was tied tightly to our team\'s use case. With the general approach we hope other teams, and the community, can reliably and easily set up and deploy `cardano-tracer`."},{"id":"2025-03-28-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-03-28-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-03-28-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-28-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2025-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 28, 2025","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.06,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2025-03-28-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-03-28-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2025-03-26-ledger"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* After upgrading hydra to new hardware and increasing eval concurrency for\\nbetter ci throughput, an upstream hydra bug caused builds to frequently block\\nin hydra\'s queue runner.

They represent the environment in which specific measurements took place, and are thus tied\\ninherently to the observation process. Additionally, to reproduce specific benchmarking metrics from the past, our performance workbench has the capability to \\"roll back\\" those updates, and perform a benchmark given the protocol parameters of any given epoch.\\nInstead of maintaining this epoch timeline by hand, we\'ve now created an automated way to extract all key epochs applying parameter updates using `db-sync`. This approach will prove both more robust, and having lower maintenance overhead.\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, the new DB storage backend for raw benchmarking data in `locli` is now set to be the default for the performance workbench. Apart from cutting down analysis time for a benchmarking run and reducing\\nthe required on-disk size for archiving, this enables the new (still under development) quick queries into raw performance data.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nWhen creating the Plutus memory scaling benchmarks, we developed so-called \'playground\' profiles for the workbench. These allow for easier dynamic change of individual profile parameters, building a resulting benchmark setup including\\nPlutus script calibration, and observing the effect in a short local cluster run. Applying these changes to established profiles is strictly forbidden, as it would put comparability with past benchmarks at risk. So by\\nintroducing this separation, we keep that safety guarantee, while still lifting it somewhat for the development cycle only.\\n\\n### New Tracing\\n\\nWe\'ve been extremely busy implementing new features and optimizations for the new tracing system, motivated by the feedback we received from the SPO community. This includes:\\n* A brand new backend that allows for Prometheus exposition of metrics directly from the application - without running `cardano-tracer` and forwarding to it.\\n* A configurable reconnection interval for the forwarder to `cardano-tracer`.\\n* An always up-to-date symlink pointing to the most recent log file in a `cardano-tracer` log rotation.\\n* Optimizations in metrics forwarding and trace message formatting, which should lower the base CPU usage, at least in low congestion scenarios.\\n\\nAll those will be part of the upcoming Node 10.3 release.  \\n\\nCurrently, the `cardano-tracer` service still depends on the Node for a few data type definitions. We\'re working on a refactoring so we can untangle this dependency. This will allow for the service\\nto be built independently of the Node - simplifying a setup where other processes and applications can forward observables to `cardano-tracer` and benefit from its features.\\n\\n\\n### Community\\n\\nWe had the opportunity to talk about benchmarking and performance impact of UTxO-HD on the very first episode of the [Cardano Dev Pulse Podcast] (YouTube).

In this series of benchmarks, we measured the performance impact of changes to the memory budgets (both transaction and block). We observed\\nan expected, and reasonable, increase in certain metrics only. Furthermore, we\'ve shown this increase to be linearly correlated to the budget raise. This means that when exploring the headroom of those budgets,\\nthe performance cost for the network is alawys predictable. The benchmarks serve as a base for discussing potential changes to those budgets in Mainnet protocol parameters.  \\n\\nWhen building a performance baseline for UTxO-HD, we were able to locate a regression in its new in-memory backing store, LedgerDB V2. We created a local reproduction of that for the Consensus team,\\nwho was able to successfully adress the regression. A corresponding benchmarking report will be published on [Cardano Updates].  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve performed benchmarks with the Ouroboros Genesis feature enabled and compared them to the release benchmark baseline. We could not detect any performance risk to the network during\\n\\"normal operations\\", i.e. when all nodes are caught up with the chain tip.\\n\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nDuring the course of building performance baselines for Ouroboros Genesis and UTxO-HD, we\'ve developed various updates to the performance workbench to correctly handle the new Genesis consensus mode, as well\\nas adjustments to the latest changes in the UTxO-HD node.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we built several small quality-of-life improvements for the workbench, as well as investigated and fixed an inconsistent metric ([Node Issue #6113]).\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe recent maintenance work also extended to the infrastructure: We\'ve removed the dependency on deprecated environment definitions in `iohk-nix` by porting the relevant configurations over to the workbench. This\\nfacilitates a thorough cleanup of `iohk-nix` by the SRE team.  \\n\\nAs the Haskell package defining benchmarking profiles has been merged, and all code replaced by it successfully removed, we\'re now working very hard on simplifying the interaction between the workbench\\nand `nix`. This mostly covers removing redundancies that have lost their motivation, applying to both how workbench calls itself recursively multiple times, as well as how (and how many) corresponding `nix` store paths\\nare created when evaluating derivations. This will both enhance maintainability, and result in much lighter workbench builds locally - but especially on CI runners.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nWork on the self-contained C library implementing trace forwarding is ongoing. As forwarding is defined in terms of an `OuroborosApplication`, it\'s non-trivial to re-implement the feautures of the latter in C as well - \\nsuch as handshake, version negotiation, and multiplexing. However, for the intended purpose of said library, it is unavoidable.  \\n\\nWe\'ve also started working on a new release of `cardano-tracer`, the trace / metrics consuming service in the new tracing system. This release is geared towards feature or change requests we\'ve received from the community\\nand found very valuable feedback. Having a seperate service to process all trace output enables us to react much quicker to this feedback, and decouple delivery from the Node\'s release cycle.\\n\\nLast not least, we\'re doing an experimental run on creating a build of Node with the legacy tracing system removed. As the system is deeply woven into the code base, and some of the new system\'s components \\nkeep compatibility with the old one, untangling and removing these dependencies is a large endeavour. This build serves as a prototype to identify potential blockers, or decisions to be made, and eventually\\nas a blueprint for removing the legacy system in some future Node release.\\n\\n\\n[Node Issue #6113]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/issues/6113\\n[Cardano Updates]: https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports"},{"id":"2025-02-19-consensus","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-02-19-consensus","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-02-19-consensus.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-19-consensus.md","title":"Consensus Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2025-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 19, 2025","tags":[{"label":"consensus","permalink":"/tags/consensus"}],"readingTime":0.66,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Nadales","title":"Consensus Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/dnadales","imageURL":"https://github.com/dnadales.png","key":"dnadales"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","slug":"2025-02-19-consensus","authors":"dnadales","tags":["consensus"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-02-21-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2025-02-19-hydra"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\n- Added a document that discuses ticking and how its used within the Consensus layer ([#1385](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/pull/138)).

After testing it (the changes\\nnever made it into a release), it turned out this could lead to attacks on the\\nsystem.  Thus, we advocate for better monitoring of nodes (e.g. if resources\\nlike file descriptors memory are available, the node is making progress)\\nrather than rely on `cardano-node` to be up and running.\\n\\n### New mux strategy for starting mini-protocols\\n\\n[Karl Knutsson][karl] ([CF]) implemented a new strategy for starting\\nmini-protocols, `StartOnDemandAny`.  A mini-protocol which is using this\\nstrategy will be started as soon as any `StartOnDemand` (or `StartOnDemandAny`)\\nmini-protocol receives input from the network.  We will use this starting\\nstrategy for the `keep-alive` mini-protocol.\\n\\n### Local-TX-Monitor protocol changes\\n\\nA new query was added, which allows the retrieval of all measures/dimensions of the\\nmempool capacity, e.g. byte-size capacity, ledger\'s execution units for both\\nmemory and execution steps, and reference\\nscripts size. See [ouroboros-network#4918].\\n\\n### Network Specification Updates\\n\\nWe made language improvements in the network specification, see\\n[ouroboros-network#5044]; and some smaller

We could not detect any performance risks, and expect network performance to be equivalent or slightly better\\nthan `10.1.x` releases, albeit using slightly more CPU resources under rare conditions.\\n\\nFurthermore, we\'re building several performance baselines with `10.2` to compare future changes, features or node flavours to. For comparative benchmarks, it\'s vital every change be measured individually, as to\\nbe able to discern their individual performance impact. For Node `10.3`, there are several of those we want to capture, such as crypto class simplifications in Ledger, UTxO-HD with a new in-memory backend,\\nOuroboros Genesis, and last not least a new GHC9.6 release addressing a remaining performance blocker when building Cardano.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve validated the \'Periodic tracer\' feature on cluster benchmarks and now have evidence of its positive impact on performance. This feature decorrelates gathering metrics from the ledger\\nfrom the start of a block producer\'s forging loop, without sacrificing predictability of performance. By removing this competition on certain synchronization primitives, the hot code path in the forging\\nloop now executes faster. The feature will be integrated in a future version of the Node.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWe\'ve tracked down a race condition in a community package that both tracing systems depend on for exposing metrics. In `ekg-wai`, a `ThreadKilled` exception could be re-thrown to the thread where\\nit originated from. It is a low-risk condition, as it occurs only when then Node process terminates; however, when terminating due to an error condition, it caused the process to end prematurely, before the\\nerror could be logged. We\'ve opened a [PR (ekg-wai#12)](https://github.com/tvh/ekg-wai/pull/12) against the package containing the fix and pre-released on CHaP.    \\n\\nTracking down this condition could have been improved by providing pervasive, human-readable labels for all the threads that the Node process spawns. So in coordination with the Consensus team,\\nwe made sure this is the case for future builds of the Node - including locations in the code where dependency packages internally use `forkIO` to create green threads. This will\\nenhance usability of debug output when looking into concurrency issues.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Haskell definition of benchmarking workloads - and the removal of its `bash`/`jq` counterpart - is complete, and has passed testing phase. This includes a final alignment between all profile content\\ndefined using either option. Once merged, this will open up the path for simplification of how `nix` interacts with the performance `workbench` - and hopefully reduce complexity for our CI runners.  \\n\\nAs `cardano-api` is deprecating some protocol parameter related data types which do not have relevance for Cardano anymore, we\'ve had a discussion with stakeholders about the implications for our tooling:\\nThis would effectively disable our ability to benchmark clusters of BFT nodes which do not use a staking / reward-based consensus algorithm - as it used to be in Cardano\'s Byron era. The decision\\nwas made to not drop that ability from our tooling, as there are potential applications for the benchmarks outside of Cardano. As a consequence, we\'ve startied porting those types to live on in our toolchain,\\nrepresenting an additonal maintenance item within our team.\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe self-contained C library implementing trace forwarding is now in prototype state. It contains a pure C implementation of our forwarding protocol over socket,\\nas well as pure C CBOR codecs for data payload to match the `TraceObject` schema used within the context Cardano. That ensures existing tooling can process traces emitted\\nby non-Cardano applications, written in languages other than Haskell.  \\n\\nThe latest updates to [Developer Portal: `cardano-tracer`] are ready to be published and awaiting a PR review on the Cardano Developer Portal.\\n\\n### Community\\n\\nWe\'ve been quite busy on our new Discord channel [_#tracing-monitoring_](https://discord.com/channels/826816523368005654/1332375957528514590) on the *IOG\'s Technical Community* server. There\'s been\\nan initial spike of interest and we\'ve been able to provide support and explain various design decisions of the new tracing system. Additionally, we\'ve gotten valuable feedback about potential\\nfeatures that would greatly help adoption of the new system. These are typically highly localized in their implementation, and non-breaking wrt. to API and design, such that addressing this\\nfeedback promptly adds much value at low risk - Thank You for your input!\\n\\n\\n\\n[Developer Portal: `cardano-tracer`]: https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/new-tracing-system/cardano-tracer"},{"id":"2025-01-31-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-01-31-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-01-31-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-31-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2025-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 31, 2025","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":0.82,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2025-01-31-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-02-03-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","permalink":"/2025-01-30-node-cli-api"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* An ephemeral support module for AWS EC2 ephemeral block devices was added to cardano-parts.\\n\\n\\n## Repository Work\\n\\n### Cardano-parts\\n* A nixosModule, `profile-aws-ec2-ephemeral`, has been added to support ec2\\n  instances with ephemeral storage block devices, offering auto-format and mount\\n  with RAID0 creation for multiple devices.

After implementing the configuration changes,\\nwe noted a statistically significant improvement in the propagation times\\nfor blocks larger than 10 segments (about 14,480 bytes) produced by IOG\'s pools.\\n\\n| Block Size (bytes)    | Improvement (ms) |\\n| --------------------- | ---------------- |\\n| 14,480 - 28,960       | -132 to -78      |\\n| 28,960 - 57,920       | -197 to -130

`10.1.4`; performance evaluation of ledger metrics trace location.\\n* Development: Database-backed quick queries for `locli` analysis tool.\\n* Infrastructure: Voting workload definition merged to `master`, work on Haskell profile definition now continues.\\n* Tracing: C library for trace forwarding and documentation ongoing; improved fallback configs.\\n* Community: new Discord channel _#tracing-monitoring_ supporting new tracing system rollout.\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nWe\'ve run and analyzed a full set of release benchmarks for Node version `10.1.4`. We could not observe any performance risks, and expect network performance to very closely match that of\\nprevious `10.1.x` releases.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve been investigating the location on the \'hot code path\' where metrics from ledger are traced - such as UTxO set size or delegation map size. This currently happens\\nat slot start, when the block forging loop is kicked off. We aim to decouple emitting those traces from the forging loop, and instead moving them to a separate thread. This thread could\\npotentially wake up after a pre-defined time has passed, like e.g. 2/3 of a slot\'s duration. That would ensure getting those values out of ledger does not occur simultaneously to block production \\nproper.  \\n\\nMoreover, as a new feature, it would enable tracing those metrics on nodes that do not run a forging loop themselves. And last not least, it would free up the way to providing additional metrics\\nat the new location - like DRep count, or DRep delegations - without negatively affecting performance. Initial prototyping has yielded promising results so far.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nParametrizable quick queries, a new feature of our analysis tool `locli`, have commenced development. They rely on the new database storage backend for raw benchmarking data to be efficient. These quick queries \\nare based on a filter-reduce framework, with composable reducers, which provide a clean way to express exposing very specific points or correlations from the raw benchmarking data.  \\n\\nThe quick query feature also incorporates ad-hoc plotting of the query results, and will incorporate exporting the result into exchange formats like CSV or JSON in the future.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe voting workload definition has been cleanly integrated with the workbench. This also includes an abstract definition of concurrent workloads - which was previously unnecessary, as exactly\\none workload would be handled by exactly one and the same service. The integration, along with the added flexibility, has been merged to `master`.  \\n\\nWe\'re now actively working again on the Haskell definition of benchmarking workloads, including a test suite. Most of this improvement had already been done; it still needs final realignment\\nwith the current state of all existing workloads. It will allow us to trade hard-to-maintain large `jq` definitions with concise testable code, and recursive shell script invocations with using a\\nwell-defined command line interface only once.\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nGood progress has been made on the small, self-contained C library that implements trace forwarding. It will allow processes in any language that can call to C via a foreign function interface\\nto use `cardano-tracer` as a target to forward traces and metrics.  The initial prototype has already evolved into a library design, which intends to offer to the host application \\na simple way to encode to Cardano\'s schema of trace messages - and to use its forwarding protocol asynchronously, as to minimize interruption of the application\'s native control flow.  \\n\\nIn preparation of the new tracing system\'s release, we\'ve also revisited the fallback configuration values the system will use if it is accidentally misconfigured by the user. The forwarder component\\nuses a bounded queue buffer for trace output to compensate for a possibly unreliable connection to `cardano-tracer`. The fallback bounds were chosen to conserve trace output at all cost - as it turns out, too high\\nof a memory cost, if trace forwarding does not happen at all, due to faulty configuration. We\'ve adjusted this and other fallback values to sensible defaults to guarantee a functional system even in case\\nof configuration errors.\\n\\n### Community\\n\\nOur team will host a new channel _#tracing-monitoring_ on *IOG\'s Technical Community* discord server. The migration to the new tracing system might affect existing automations built by the community, or how\\nexisting configuration need adjusting to achieve the intended outcome. In the channel, we\'ll offer support for the community in all those regards, as well as answer more general questions regarding the Node\'s tracing systems.\\n\\nAdditionally, we\'re currently releasing our documentation improvements to the excellent [Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org), linked below.\\n\\n* [Discord channel #tracing-monitoring](https://discord.com/channels/826816523368005654/1332375957528514590)\\n* [Developer Portal: New Tracing quickstart](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/new-tracing-system/new-tracing-system)\\n* [Developer Portal: `cardano-tracer`](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/new-tracing-system/cardano-tracer)"},{"id":"2025-01-17-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025-01-17-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2025-01-17-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-17-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2025-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 17, 2025","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.895,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2025-01-17-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2025-01-17-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2025-01-15-ledger"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* Sanchonet was respun after a community scheduled test hardfork to PV11\\n\\n* Buildkite agent modules were added to cardano-playground\\n\\n* Adds a latest tag GHA action to cardano-node upon new release publication\\n\\n## Repository Work\\n\\n### Cardano-parts\\n* Cardano-node has been updated to `10.1.4`, cardano-cli and the -ng variant to\\n  `10.1.1.0` and `10.2.0.0` respectively, and mithril to `v2450`.

That being said, this is also the time when everyone goes on\\nvacation. Therefore the report is larger than usual, but not as big as if two periods of reporting\\nwere skipped at a usual time.\\n\\nMost of the effort was spent on polishing up some of the Conway features before the upcoming Plomin\\nhard fork that is scheduled to happen some time in January, as well as continued testing of the\\nConway features in order to improve our confidence in the upcoming hard fork. Because of this effort\\nwe nailed a couple of serious bugs, fixes for which are included in the latest release, which is why\\nan upgrade for all SPOs to the newest version of `cardano-node-10.1.4` is highly advisable.\\n\\nAnother big allocation of effort was towards tackling some of the technical debt accrued over the years.\\n\\nThe most significant change by far in this report is the removal of crypto parameterization from\\nevery era definition in Ledger. This change was not only a huge simplification for the Ledger\\ncodebase, but it will be just as big of a simplification for all of the downstream users of\\nLedger. Most importantly, this change will finally allow us to switch to the newer version of the\\nGHC compiler, because it addresses the performance regression that the newer compiler version was\\nsusceptible to.\\n\\nOne more major accomplishment that we can share is a drastic change to how serialization of UTxO\\nhappens in the ledger state. This change is planned to solve a long standing problem with blocks\\nbeing missed due to the garbage collector kicking in at the time when the ledger snapshot was being\\ncreated. Moreover this change will have a significant positive impact on UTxOHD performance when it\\nwill finally be released.\\n\\nAnother big milestone, with respect to tackling technical debt is a release of our cryptographic\\nlibrary, which was undergoing some major changes throughout the last couple of years. It was finally\\nreleased and integrated into Ledger with all of the other downstream components set to follow.\\n\\nWe can also finally conclude our work on defining CDDL specification in Haskell as is it is now\\ncompletely generated from a Haskell definition for all of the eras. Thanks to this effort we not\\nonly have a better confidence in the accuracy of our CDDL specification, due to extra type checking\\nand testing we now get thanks to Haskell, but it also reduces duplication and complexity that usedq\\nto stem from manual serialization specification definition for every Ledger era.\\n\\n\\n## Low level summary\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n* [pull-4778] -

benchmarks on Node `10.0`; workload implementation being generalized to be mergeable.\\n* Development: Database-backend for our analysis tool `locli` merged; several metrics improvements with new tracing.\\n* Tracing: C library for trace forwarding started; documentation improved; timing issue in forwarder fixed.\\n\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nThe voting benchmarks have now finished. The exact implementation of how the voting workload is set up and submitted has been finalized and is\\ncurrently being prepared for merging into `master`. This will add those benchmarks to the repertoire we can run on any future node version, and \\ntrack potential performance changes of voting over time.\\n\\nThe setup allows us to add voting as an additional workload on top of the existing release benchmarking workloads - typically \\"value-only\\"\\nand \\"Plutus loop\\". The value workload operates at 12TPS and always results in full blocks; we can draw a straight line comparison when\\na certain, constant percentage of each blocks is filled with vote transactions. The Plutus workload however is throttled by spending the block execution budget,\\nand not so much by transaction size and TPS - contrary to voting submissions. This results in a large variance in block size that the network produces, and\\nrestricting analysis to the blocks that are actually comparable to each other greatly reduces sample size.  \\n\\nThis means that in practice, we\'ve found \\"voting on top of value-only\\" to represent the performance implications of voting most accurately. This workload will\\nserve as a base for comparison over time, and will be run selectively on new versions, whenever the proposal / voting feature of the Conway ledger is touched.  \\n\\nAs a conclusion to those benchmarks we\'ve ascertained that:\\n1. there is a performance cost to voting, vote tallying and proposal enactment\\n2. on the system level, this cost is very reasonable and poses no operational risk\\n3. on the service level, processing an individual voting transaction is even slightly cheaper performance-wise than a transaction consuming and creating multiple UTxO entries\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nThe analysis and reporting tool, `locli` (\\"LogObject CLI\\") now comes equipped with a database-backed persistence layer. This new backend has\\nbeen validated by using it to re-analyse past benchmarks. Performance workbench integration has been completed, and by means of a new envvar \\nthis backend can be enabled for use in automations. It currently co-exists in `locli` with the default file system based persistence backend.  \\n\\nApart from opening up raw benchmarking data to the full power of SQL queries, or quickly marshalling it into another format to feed into other\\napplications, the new storage backend has considerable advantages regarding execution speed and resource usage. It both requires less RAM (around 30% less)\\nduring runtime, and less disk space - about 90% less! Standard analysis of a cluster run can now be performed in less than an hour, whereas it took around 2h before.  \\n\\nCurrently, we\'re working on implementing parametrizable quick queries of that raw data - complete with adding plotting capabilities to `locli`. The queries are\\nmeant to easily extract and visualize very specific correlations that are not part of standard analysis, catering to the oftentimes investigative nature of performance analysis.\\n\\nFurthermore, The new tracing system now provides direct insight into the chain tip\'s hash, exposing `tipBlockHash`, `tipBlockParentHash` and `tipBlockIssuerVerificationKeyHash` both as trace\\nmessages and metrics. Additionally, we\'ve merged a fix for issue [cardano-node#5751]: the metric `forging_enabled` now correctly also observes the presence of the CLI option `--non-producing-node`.\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe new tracing system allows for trace and metrics forwarding from some process to `cardano-tracer`. For any Haskell application, the forwarder package can\\neasily be included as a library. For applications written in other programming languages, we\'ve decided a small, self-contained C library that handles forwarding is a viable\\nway to provide this functionality to a much wider range of ecosystems. The C library will implement protocol handshake and possibly muxing, the forwarder protocol messages being used,\\nand CBOR-based encodings of trace messages and metrics - which only exists in Haskell currently. We\'ve just started the prototype.  \\n\\nWe\'ve been working hard on updating and improving the documentation for the new tracing system on https://developers.cardano.org (not merged yet). The aim was to provide a quick start guide\\nto \\"just get it set up and running\\", without presupposing any knowledge of tracing, or Haskell. Moreover, for users coming from the legacy tracing system, we wanted to highlight the key\\ndifferences between systems - and possibly different assumptions when operating them.   \\n\\nLast not least, we caught a very interesting timing issue in the forwarder: each service connected to `cardano-tracer` bears both an internal and external name for the connection (both unique), where\\nthe external name is chosen by the service itself. Upon forwarder initialization, so called data points are set up within the service, into which data can then be traced (such as that external name),\\nand which are actively polled / queried by `cardano-tracer`. As these are all concurrent events, the external name wasn\'t yet available in the data point, if initialization of forwarding happened \\"too fast\\". Once\\nlocated, fixing this was trivial by enforcing a relative ordering of concurrent events just during initialization.\\n\\n\\n### Happy New Year!\\n\\nIt\'s been an amazing year for the Performance & Tracing team. We\'re proud to have contributed to Cardano\'s transition into the age of Voltaire, and reliably safeguarded performance\\nof the Cardano network - and to have finalized our new tracing system. A huge thanks to all those who\'ve been helpful, supportive - and who\'ve presented us with new ideas and challanges.\\n\\nHave a Happy New Year 2025!\\n\\n[cardano-node#5751]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/issues/5751"},{"id":"2024-12-23-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-12-23-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-12-23-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-23-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"Overview of sprint 77","date":"2024-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 23, 2024","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/tags/network"}],"readingTime":1.795,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2024-12-23-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-12-30-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"SRE Team Update","permalink":"/2024-12-20-sre"}},"content":"## Overview of [sprint 77][sprint-77]\\n\\n### Initiator only mode for local roots\\n\\nWe implemented the initiator-only mode for local roots peers described in\\n[ouroboros-network#5020].

Approximately four to five of these transactions are submitted every\\nhour.\\n\\nSince early November, network load has increased, but most transactions are\\nstill included within the first or second block after submission. Even if the\\nnetwork is not congested, transactions may not reach the Block Producer\\nresponsible for the next block in time due to network propagation delays.\\nTherefore, only a transaction that takes three or more blocks to be included\\nindicates a loaded network.\\n\\nSince November 1, 2024, we have submitted around 3,700 \\"canary\\" transactions,\\nand only 59 of them took longer than two blocks to be included, meaning 98.4%\\nof our test transactions were included within the two-block limit. During this\\nperiod, the longest observed time to inclusion was five blocks for two\\ntransactions and the maximum wait time is 201 seconds.\\n\\n![Network Load](../static/images/network/2024-12-10-network-load.png)\\n\\nWhere the y-axis is a fraction of the block size in the respected dimension (e.g.\\nsize, steps, memory).\\n\\n### Hot Standby Block-Producer Nodes\\n\\nIn the last Network Working Group Meeting (**NWG**) we discussed solutions for\\nrunning hot standby block producers using P2P.  \\n\\n### Short-Term Solution: Local Root Initiator Only Outbound Connections\\n\\nWe agreed to implement initiator-only connections for local roots, which\\nwouldn\'t bind to the node address (and thus would be made from an ephemeral\\nport).  This allows SPOs to have hot standby nodes which are hidden from relays\\nusing a firewall rule, while they still can connect to the relays (so they\\nreceive blocks while the blocks they produce are not sent to the network).

Secondly, introduce a scaling parameter - namely the number of votes submitted per transaction, and hence\\nthe number of proposals to be considered simultaneously for tallying and ratification. On the way, we improved upon timing of submissions, as\\nthis has caused benchmarks to abort mid-run every now and then: in those cases, a newly created UTxO entry just hadn\'t settled across the cluster when it was\\nsupposed to be reused for consumption.  \\n\\nScaling of the voting workload is currently under analysis.\\n\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nOur analysis and reporting tool, `locli` (\\"LogObject CLI\\") has a few drawbacks as far as system resource usage goes; it requires a huge\\namount of RAM, and initialization (i.e. loading and parsing trace output) is quite slow. Moreover, there is no intermediate, potentially\\nexposable or queryable, representation of data besides the trace messages themselves.  \\n\\n We\'re working on a prototype that introduces a database persistence layer as that intermediate representation. Not only does that open\\n up raw benchmarking data to other means of querying or processing outside `locli`. Initializing the tool from the database has also shown\\n to require much less RAM, and to improve duration of the initialization phase. Furthermore, on-disk representation is much more efficient that\\n way - which is no small benefit when raw benchmarking data for a single run can occupy north of 64GiB.\\n\\n The prototype has yet to be fully integrated into the analysis pipeline for validation, however, initial observations are promising. \\n\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nFor our benchmarks, we rely on staked geneses, as the cluster needs control all stake, and such, block production, to yield meaningful performance\\nmetrics. As creating a staked genesis of that extent is an expensive operation, we use a caching mechanism for those. Small changes in the benchmarking\\nprofile, such as protocol version or parameters, Plutus cost models or execution budgets would usually trigger the creation of a new cache entry. We\'ve\\nnow factored out from cache entry resolution all those variables that do not impact staking itself. We then created a mechnanism to patch those\\nchanges into genesis files after cache retrieval, when preparing them for a benchmarking run. This adds flexibility for creating profiles, and reduces the\\ntime to deploy a run to the cluster.  \\n\\nWe also delivered a comprehensive description of our cluster to the Leios innovation team. This includes the definition of our artificially constrained\\ntopology, as well as a latency matrix for node connections in that topology, assigning a weight to all edges in the graph. The Leios team intends\\nto use that material to implement a large-scale simulation of the algorithm, and thus gain representative timings for diffusion and propagation.\\n\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe alignment of metrics names between legacy and new tracing system is now complete - which should minimize the migration effort of existing dashboards for the community. The only differences that remain are motivated by increasing compliance with existing standards like e.g. OpenMetrics. Furthermore, a few metrics still\\nmissing in the new system have now been ported over, such as `node.start.time` or `served.block.latest`.  \\n\\nWe\'re all set for the expected bump to `typed-protocols-0.3`: both forwarder packages `trace-forward` and `ekg-forward` for the new tracing\\nsystem have been adapted to the new API and are passing all tests.\\n\\nLast not least, we\'ve settled on a rollout plan for the new tracing system. The new system will set to be the **default** with the upcoming Node\\nrelease `10.2`. This is achieved by a change of configuration only - there is no need for different Node builds. The `cardano-node` binary\\nwill contain both tracing systems for a considerable grace period: 3 - 6 months after release. This should give the community ample time to\\nadjust for necessary changes in downstream services or dashboards that consume trace or metrics output.  \\n\\nWe\'ll provide a comprehensive hands-on migration guide summarizing those changes for the user."},{"id":"2024-11-15-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-11-15-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-11-15-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-15-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 15, 2024","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.475,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2024-11-15-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-11-18-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2024-11-14-hydra"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* Cardano-node release `10.1.2` was deployed to all environments\\n\\n* Dbsync release `13.6.0.1` was deployed to all environments\\n\\n* Just recipe `query-gov-action-status` was added to aid in live voting\\n  analysis of governance actions\\n\\n* The mainnet bootstrap cluster was scaled temporarily to accommodate a\\n  significant increase in client load which developed during the past week\\n\\n* With scheduled end of year vacation time and holidays starting, the cadence\\n  of work is expected to slow a bit in the following few node SRE updates\\n\\n## Repository Work\\n\\n### Capkgs\\n* Credential-manager bins were added for use in cardano-parts ops devShell\\n  [capkgs-commit-8cabb18](https://github.com/input-output-hk/capkgs/commit/8cabb189a5d48cb414acbc7496d26033615ac2aa)\\n\\n### Cardano-parts\\n* Sets cardano-node to `10.1.2`, dbsync to `13.6.0.1`, mithril to `v2445.0`, faucet\\n  to `10.1`.

performed PlutusV3 RIPEMD-160 benchmarks.\\n* Development: Governance action workload fully implemented; generator-based is submission ongoing work.\\n* Tracing: New tracing system production ready - `cardano-tracer-0.3` released; work advancing on `typed-protocols-0.3` bump and metrics naming.\\n\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nWe\'ve run and analyzed the new voting workload on Node `10.0`. This workload is a stream of voting transactions submitted on top of the existing\\nvalue workload from release benchmarking. The delta in the comparison can claim to demonstrate the \\"performance cost of voting\\" in the Conway ledger era.\\nThe workload itself is a puppeteer of 10.000 DReps overall, who vote on up to 5 governance actions simultaneously. We made sure these are\\nmutually independent proposals, that vote tallying occurs, and that the actions get ratified and enacted (and hence removed from the ledger). Then, voting moves on to\\nthe next actions - keeping the number of actions needing vote tallying stable over the benchmark. We could observe a very slight performance cost of voting; it\'s\\ndeemed to be a reasonable one given the stress we\'ve put the system under.  \\n\\nThe results can be found [here](/reports/2024-10-performance-10.1.1) along with those from release benchmkarks.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve developed and run a new Plutus benchmark targeting the RIPEMD-160 internal. We\'ve compared the resulting performance observations against\\nother Plutus workloads - both memory-constrained and (same as RIPEMD-160) CPU-constrained. We have concluded that there are no performance risks to that algorithm in PlutusV3,\\ngiven existing execution budgets, and that it\'s consistently priced wrt. other CPU-intensive internals.\\n\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nThe voting workload is currently implemented using decentralized submission via `cardano-cli` on each of our cluster machines. It has proven reliable - and scalable,\\nat least to some extent. We\'re already working on improvements that reduce the (very slight) overhead of using the CLI for submission. Additionally, we\'re aiming\\nfor a linear performance comparison when submitting twice the number votes per transaction at the same TPS rate - forcing double the work for vote tallying. \\n\\nImplementation of that workload using the centralized (and much better scalable) `tx-generator` submission service is still ongoing.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nMetrics naming is currently receiving a last round of consistency checking, so that it\'s aligned as closely as possible between legacy and new tracing system. In the process, we\'re\\nadressing aspects of documentation, and incorporating feedback to define a few metrics in the new system that previously were present in the legacy one only. \\n\\nFor migrating to the new `typed-protocols-0.3` API, two of the new tracing system\'s packages are affected. The work for `ekg-forward-0.7` is completed and merged to `master` - yet to be released on CHaP. Work on the second package, `trace-forward`, is ongoing.\\n\\nWe\'ve finally released `cardano-tracer-0.3`, which incorporates all features, enhancements and fixes that have been reported on here over the past months. This release\\nmarks 100% production readiness of the new tracing system. We\'re focusing now on making documentation and example scripts and configs yet more user-friendly for\\ncommunity rollout. We\'re very much looking forward to receiving feedback - and have time and space reserved to address it, as well as to provide intial support for\\nthe migration away from the legacy system."},{"id":"2024-11-01-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-11-01-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-11-01-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-01-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 1, 2024","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.315,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2024-11-01-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-11-04-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2024-10-30-consensus"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* Cardano-node \\\\[pre-]releases from `10.0.0-pre`, `10.1.0-pre` and `10.1.1` were deployed to appropriate environments\\n\\n* Sanchonet was respun on `2024-10-21` for cardano-node >= `10.0.0-pre`\\n\\n* Private and shelley-qa chains were retired for now\\n\\n* Remaining cardano-world legacy resources have now been terminated\\n\\n* Some ci-world legacy resources were migrated in prep for termination of the remainder\\n\\n\\n## Repository Work\\n\\n### Cardano-faucet\\n* Cardano-faucet was updated for cardano-node 10.1 compatibility.\\n  [cardano-faucet-pull-16](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-faucet/pull/16)\\n\\n### Cardano-parts\\n* Sets cardano-node to `10.1.1`, mithril to `v2442.0` and updates iohk-nix-ng for\\n  the recent sanchonet respin.

It appears that speculative evaluation (a feature absent from GHC8) can, in some cases, lead to overeager evaluation - and hence to\\nan unnecessary performance impact on the system. We\'ve created a build of the Node with a patched version of GHC9.6 which disables speculative evaluation for these cases only - and then we\'ve run our release benchmark workloads on\\na cluster of those nodes. The raw data is still under analysis, but initial results look promising.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nThe new governance action / voting workload for cluster-wide benchmarks is still under works. Our submission service `tx-generator` is now able to assume the identity of all registered DReps to sign votes. Currently, we\'re working\\non defining (and correctly throttling) a stream of those votes, such that a constant number of open proposals keep receiving votes throughout the entire benchmarking run.\\n\\n\\n### Workbench\\n \\nThe Haskell service to create benchmarking profile content, `cardano-profile`, has been in beta use for some time now. It has proven to be much more maintainable, and its approach to declare profile content is much more principled than the\\nexisting implementation with `jq` / `bash`. We\'ve decided to switch to that service for good, including a final validation of all possible profiles between implementations. In the same go, we\'ll take the opportunity to remove some\\nbulky parts of `workbench` which were motivated by the `jq` implementation, as well as simplify the corresponding nix evaluations (and redundant shell invocations).\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nFurther adjustments to the metrics naming schema in the new tracing system is ongoing.    \\n\\nFor `cardano-tracer`, several PRs have successfully landed. EKG monitoring is now capable of serving many metrics stores from just one process. Prometheus exposition has been made OpenMetrics compliant. The space leaks in the forwarding\\nbackend have been verifiably closed, and the log rotation issue has been resolved. Thus, `cardano-tracer` will see (alongside the next Node release) a new major release `0.3`. This release is considered to be 100% production-ready.\\n\\n### Consensus QTAs\\n\\n`beacon` - a first step in building a benchmarking framework based on Delta-Q system design - has received a fully functional automation. According to the design we settled on 3 months ago, it\'s now possible to test, manage, and deploy\\na nix service for a self-hosted GitHub runner which performs `beacon` benchmarks on pre-defined workload fragments. The runner can be triggered automatically or manually. As the nix service will likely share a host with other, potentially\\nresource intensive tasks, a locking mechanism is implemented to prevent distortion of the measurements. The automation is now entering testing phase."},{"id":"2024-10-04-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-10-04-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-10-04-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-04-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 4, 2024","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.555,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2024-10-04-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-10-07-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2024-10-03-hydra"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* All environments have been upgraded to cardano-node `9.2.1`.\\n\\n* Cardano-faucet `9.2` is available and deployed which is compatible with node\\n  `9.2.x` and has fixed ipv6 functionality.\\n\\n* All deployed machines now default to nix `2.24-maint` after an upstream bug\\n  causing a hash miscalculation in submodules has been fixed.

Validating the new \\"age of Voltaire\\" performance baseline.\\n* Development - New Tracing System: A space leak in the forwarding mechanism was fixed; a log rotation bug is being investigated.\\n* Workbench: Large refactoring of `workbench`, optimizing nix closure size and adding profile flake outputs. Adjusted Nomad backend was merged.\\n* Infrastructure: Dropping `Vault` for the Nomad cluster was tested and merged.\\n* Tracing: Further metrics names alignment; be OpenMetrics specs compliant; adding annotations to Prometheus metrics; internal monitoring servers routing has entered testing.\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nWe\'ve run and analyzed a full set of release benchmarks for Node version `9.2.0`. In comparison with Mainnet release `9.1.1`, we could not observe any performance regression.  \\n\\nMoreover, we\'ve validated the stability of our new \\"age of Voltaire\\" performance baseline on `9.1.1`. Currently, we\'re running a cross-comparison between baselines and Node versions `9.1.1` and `9.2.0` to ascertain that\\nthe new baseline arrives - at scale - at the same performance observations and predictions as the previous one.\\n\\n### Development - New Tracing System\\n\\nForwarding traces and metrics in the new system exhibited a tiny space leak. Under conventional operation, this leak would only become noticeable after running uninterrupted for days or even weeks. It took very hard pressure on the\\nsystem, and additional profiling, to make it visible. It could be fixed by avoiding unnecessary allocations of continuations: The buffer of objects to forward inherently carries the position of the next object to process, such that a fully\\nevaluated closure can trivially be reused to handle any subsequent forwarding request. This has led to new versions of packages `trace-foward-2.2.7` and `ekg-forward-0.6`. Huge thanks to John Lotoski and Javier Sagredo, whose\\nmeticulous information helped to swiftly address the issue.  \\n\\nOn the benchmarking cluster, we\'ve observed `cardano-tracer`\'s log rotation to occasionally misbehave: under certain circumstances, the service leaks handles by not redirecting output to the latest log file in the rotation. We\'ve located the\\nissue and are working towards a fix.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nWe\'ve been working on a major refactoring of `workbench` code. The main benefit of this endeavour is being able to pull in a very heavy dependency optionally only when required, when building and running the `workbench` shell. This will especially facilitate runs on CI machines after garbage collections, but also building a local shell on individual developer machines. Additionally, benchmarking profiles designed for the cluster are now provided as nix flake outputs. This allows for building a more versatile automation in the future, where `workbench` and `cardano-node` commits won\'t need to be tied to each other. Last not least, the refactoring simplified the way the shell commands are evaluated, doing away with nested calls in many instances. The refactoring PR has been thouroughly tested and merged.\\n\\nFurthermore, the workbench is now prepared for a `nixpkgs` upgrade and has dropped the container-based Nomad / `podman` backend - the respective PR was merged successfully.  \\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nRemoval of the `Vault` service for managing benchmarking cluster credentials has been successfully tested and merged. The service is scheduled for final shutdown end of month, reducing hardware cost and maintenance effort.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nWe\'ve received initial feedback regarding the alignment of metrics names between new and legacy tracing systems. Based upon that feedback, we\'re currently working on some further adjustments to the naming schema.    \\n\\nThe implementation for hosting multiple EKG monitors in one single service has been finished and is currently in the testing phase. The dynamic routing to monitoring data, now used both for EKG and Prometheus, reflects the nodes that are connected to `cardano-tracer`. We\'ve also added a JSON response format, which makes it easier to query and scrape existing routes as part of automations. Finally, this PR also removes the dependency on the `snap` server framework and transitively on `HsOpenSSL` (which is prone to cause build issues in the future).  \\n\\nCurrently, we\'re working on various improvements to the Prometheus metric expositions in `cardano-tracer`. We aim to implement full compliance with the OpenMetrics specification, which should greatly enhance integration processes. Furthermore, metrics\\nwill be augmented with `# TYPE` and `# HELP` annotations, as tracked in issue [cardano-node#5021].\\n\\nLast not least, we\'ve closed off issue [cardano-node#3988]. For adding an optional prefix to metrics names, the Node config option `TraceOptionMetricsPrefix` can now be used. \\n\\n[cardano-node#5021]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/issues/5140\\n[cardano-node#3988]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/issues/3988"},{"id":"2024-09-20-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-09-20-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-09-20-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-20-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 20, 2024","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.39,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2024-09-20-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-09-23-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2024-09-18-consensus"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on Cardano environment improvements and general maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* All environments have been upgraded to cardano-node `9.2.0`.\\n\\n* All IOE run cardano-parts clusters (ie: sanchonet, preview, preprod, etc\\n  testnets, mainnet and network-team clusters) have been upgraded to support\\n  ipv4/ipv6 dual stack operations.

Routing to internal monitoring servers is ongoing. Dropping dependency on `HsOpenSSL`.\\n\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nRuns and analyses for a full set of release benchmarks have been performed for Node version `9.1.1`. In comparison with Mainnet releases `9.0` and `9.1.0`, we could determine this version does not exhibit any performance regression.  \\n\\nHaving been provided with the patch by Consensus targeting the increased RAM usage of the UTxO-HD in-memory backend (read below), we\'ve performed additional benchmarks to validate the desired result on the cluster. Our measurements demonstrate the increased\\nmemory need has now vanished. We\'re confident that by now we\'ve located - and addressed - all performance risks for UTxO-HD in-memory that we can capture given the instruments at our disposal. To gain further confidence in the stability\\nof resource usage pattern and network metrics observed on the benchmarking cluster, we\'ve advised long-running UTxO-HD nodes under close monitoring.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWe succeeded in creating a local reproduction of the increase in RAM usage that was observed for the UTxO-HD in-memory backend on the cluster. That reproduction enabled the Consensus team to inspect in real-time and profile running Node processes - which\\nled to a swift identification of the underlying cause and a patch addressing it.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nAfter the smooth Chang hard fork which transitioned Cardano into the Conway era, we\'ve created - and merged - a new performance baseline. It\'s intended for release benchmarks and caters to the new features of the Conway ledger. Apart from incorporating the latest protocol version and Plutus cost models, it includes DRep presence in ledger when performing measurements.  \\n\\nThe PR preparing our workbench for a `nixpkgs` upgrade and removing the container-based Nomad / `podman` backend is complete and has entered testing phase.  \\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nCurrently, our Nomad cluster uses `Vault` to manage access and credentials for the benchmarking cluster. As the cluster exclusively relies on static routes, and fixed deployment endpoints, encoding access as a set of rules into the cloud infrastructure\\nis a viable option. That way, we will no longer depend on the `Vault` service, removing the requirement of hosting, and maintaining, an instance of it.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nAligning the metrics naming schema and semantics between new and legacy tracing systems has been completed and merged. This will enable a seamless interchange in the community, as all existing configurations of monitoring services remain their validity.  \\n\\nAs for hosting multiple EKG metrics monitors in one single service application, we ascertained that the `ekg` package was not built for that use case. However, we\'ve come up with a much nicer design for `cardano-tracer` using dynamic routing based on the names of nodes\\nconnected to it. It has successfully passed prototype stage in that it\'s able to serve multiple EKG monitors without the need for any server restart; the full implementation is being worked on.  \\n\\nLast not least, both existing tracing systems rely on the `snap` server framework, and thus by transitive dependency, on `HsOpenSSL` to speak the HTTPS protocol. However, we\'ve determined the latter package to have a risk of breaking the build, both currently and in the future (cf. [HsOpenSSL#95] and [HsOpenSSL#88]). As a consequence, a switch to the `wai` / `warp` based framework was decided, which implements HTTPS capability differently, thus preempting the risk. This has already been carried out for the legacy system, and currently is\\nfor `cardano-tracer` - a big shoutout to Erik de Castro Lopo for his support on that issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n[HsOpenSSL#95]: https://github.com/haskell-cryptography/HsOpenSSL/issues/95\\n[HsOpenSSL#88]: https://github.com/haskell-cryptography/HsOpenSSL/issues/88"},{"id":"2024-09-07-incident","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-09-07-incident","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-09-07-incident.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-07-incident.md","title":"Blocks from the future","description":"Blocks from the future","date":"2024-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 7, 2024","tags":[{"label":"security","permalink":"/tags/security"},{"label":"consensus","permalink":"/tags/consensus"}],"readingTime":1.125,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Hammond","title":"Head of Software Engineering, Cardano Core","url":"https://github.com/kevinhammond","imageURL":"https://github.com/kevinhammond.png","key":"kevinhammond"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Blocks from the future","slug":"2024-09-07-incident","authors":"kevinhammond","tags":["security","consensus"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-09-09-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"SRE Team Update","permalink":"/2024-09-06-sre"}},"content":"## Blocks from the future\\n\\nWe identified two issues relating to \\"blocks from the future\\".\\n\\n1.

Comparing with the mainnet release `9.0`, we could not observe any performance regression.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve performed feature benchmarks for an upcoming new API for `typed-protocols`. Those did not \\nexhibit any regression either in comparison with the baseline using the current API.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve performed various benchmarks for the UTxO-HD in-memory backend on Node versions `9.0` and `9.1`. Based\\non those observations, a rare race condition could be eliminated, where block producers on occasion failed to fork off a thread for the forging loop. The overall network performance of the UTxO-HD in memory backend shows a slight improvement over the regular node, but currently comes with a slightly increased RAM usage.\\n\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWe\'ve spotted an inconsistency in one of our benchmarking metrics - CPU 85% spans - which measures the average number\\nof consecutive slots where CPU usage spikes to 85% or higher (however short the spike itself might be). There was a difference between legacy tracing system (which yielded the correct value) and the new one, for which a fix has already been devised.  \\n\\nThe implementation of Conway governance action workloads for benchmarking is ongoing.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nWith a `nixpkgs` bump on the horizon, we\'re working on adjusting, and testing, our usage of packages that change their status, lose their support, or packages that require pinning a version for the workbench.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ll remove a container-based backend for workbench, which ties in OCI image usage on `podman` with\\nNomad. It was a precursor to the current Nomad backend, which is containerless and can directly build Nomad jobs using `nix`.  \\n\\nLast not least, we\'ve merged a small PR which enables our workbench to build `nix` shells with GHC9.8, as this not only\\npulls in the compiler, but much of the Haskell development toolchain. The correct version couplings between compiler and toolchain components is now declared explicitly from GHC8.10.7 up to GHC9.8.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nWe\'ve tested and validated an upcoming change in `ouroboros-network` which demands any node-to-node submission client to\\nhold the connection for at least one minute before being able to submit transactions. The change works\\nas expected and does not interfere with special functionality required by benchmarking.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe trace consumer service for the new tracing system used to require `systemd` on Linux to build and operate. There are, however, Linux environments that choose to not use `systemd`. It is now possible to configure the desired flavour of that service, `cardano-tracer`, at build time, thus adding support for those Linuxes - [cardano-node#5021].  \\n\\n`cardano-tracer` consumes not just traces, but also metrics. With the new tracing system, this shifts running a\\nmetrics server from the node to the consumer process. One possible setup in the new system is operating only one consumer service and connecting multiple nodes to it. In its current design, this requires to safely shutdown and restart the monitoring server, using the metrics store of any connected node that\'s been requested. We\'re currently\\nbattle-testing `ekg`\'s (the monitoring package that\'s being used) built-in behaviour and exploring solutions in case it does not fully meet requirements.\\n\\n\\n[cardano-node#5021]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/issues/5021"},{"id":"2024-08-20-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-08-20-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-08-20-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-20-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"High-level overview of sprint 68","date":"2024-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 20, 2024","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/tags/network"}],"readingTime":1.64,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2024-08-20-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-08-21-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","permalink":"/2024-08-20-node-cli-api"}},"content":"## High-level overview of [sprint 68][sprint-68]\\n\\n### Peer Sharing\\n\\nKarl Knutsson ([CF]) produces graphs which show how peer sharing usage expands on mainnet.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src=\\"/images/network/2024-08-21-peer-sharing-1.png\\" alt=\\"Peer Sharing: discovered unique peers\\" width=\\"600\\" />\\n<img src=\\"/images/network/2024-08-21-peer-sharing-2.png\\" alt=\\"Peer Sharing: discovered unique peers\\" width=\\"600\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\nPrivate relays in the last graph are relays which we are not certain that are\\nregistered on the chain.\\n\\n### Typed Protocols\\n\\nWe conducted an investigation whether the new proposed `typed-protocols`\\nversion (see [typed-protocols#52] introduces any performance regression.

Work on metrics naming ongoing, minimizing migration effort.\\n* Consensus QTAs: Design for automating and data warehousing `beacon` measurements is complete.\\n\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nRuns and analyses for a full set of release benchmarks have been performed - and published - for Node version `9.0.0`. Comparing with the latest mainnet release `8.12.1`, we could not observe any performance regression. `9.0.0` exhibits\\nan improvement in Block Fetch duration, which results in slightly better overall network performance.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve performed scaling benchmarks of Plutus execution budgets. In these series of benchmarks, we measure the performance impact of changes to those budgets in the protocol parameters. Steps (CPU) and memory budgets\\nare scaled independently of each other, and performance testing takes place using Plutus scripts that either are heavy on allocations but light on CPU, or vice versa. These performance tests are meant to explore the headroom of those budgets, taking\\ninto account cost model changes, and recent optimization capabilites of the Plutus compiler.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nOur workload submission service `tx-generator` has been equipped with the ability to handle POSIX signals for graceful shutdown scenarios. Furthermore, as it is highly concurrent, error reporting on a per-thread basis has been added, enhancing feedback from the service.\\nAlong with some quality-of-life improvements, these changes have landed in `master`.  \\n \\nThe Conway governance action workloads for benchmarking have completed design phase, and we\'ve settled on an implementation plan. Implementation work itself has started.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nGenerating the contents for any benchmarking profile has now become a dedicated Haskell tool, `cardano-profile`, which has landed in `master`. Adding type safety and a test suite to profile definitions is a major improvement over\\nshell code that directly manipulates JSON objects. Furthermore, it makes reliably modifying, or creating, benchmarking profiles much more accessible to engineers outside of our team.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nWith factoring out RTView, and making it an opt-in component of the `cardano-tracer` build, we\'ve reduced the service\'s dependency graph significantly. Furthermore, the service has become more lightweight on resources. We\'ll continue to maintain\\nRTView, and guarantee it will remain buildable and usable in the future.  \\n\\nAligning metrics naming and semantics of new and legacy tracing is ongoing work. This task is part of a larger endeavour to minimize the effort necessary for users to migrate to the new system.\\n\\n### Consensus QTAs\\n\\n`beacon`, which currently measures performance of certain ledger operations on actual workload fragments, is a first step in building a benchmarking framework based on Delta-Q system design and quantitative timeliness agreements.

These recordings should be accessible to a technical\\naudience.\\n\\n### Introduction to Ouroboros Network, NWG, part 1\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J_o2iGy4jeIR6X1x9D6p_nHKLCNjgX6h/preview\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"480\\"></iframe>\\n\\n### Introduction to Ouroboros Network, NWG, part 2\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CsqC1R_GMliWkKJaeSCf-xrZG6F6yvMv/preview\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"480\\"></iframe>\\n<iframe src=\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QV46QqmpkfPVcoKxueYHg4Qe7rPQzOer/preview\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"480\\"></iframe>\\n\\n### Tx-Submission\\n\\nWe continued working on the new design of tx-submission.  We progressed in writing\\na new tx-submission server (inbound side of tx-submission protocol)\\ninstrumented by decision logic.  The next step is writing a simulation that\\nruns N-pairs of `client`-`server` communications in which the same decision logic governs all `server`s - emulating the behaviour of `cardano-node` once the new tx-submission is integrated.  For more details, see\\n[ouroboros-network#3311]\\n\\n### Genesis integration\\n\\nAll outstanding PRs related to Genesis have been reviewed and accepted.  Soon\\nthey will be merged.\\n\\n* **Big Ledger Peer Targets for Genesis** - [ouroboros-network#4832]\\n* **Feed peer selection governor with big ledger peers obtained from a snapshot** - [ouroboros-network#4850]\\n* **Introduction of serialization instances in support of ledger peer snapshot** - [ouroboros-network#4851]\\n* **Verification of big ledger peer snapshot file** - [ouroboros-network#4888]\\n\\n### Mithril Integration\\n\\nWe presented ideas on how to run mithril functionalities with\\n`cardano-node` while taking into account the risks that such integration would impose on\\nthe system.  The technical description will be part of a CIP, which will then go to\\nthe Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for an evaluation.\\n\\n## Smaller tasks\\n\\n* **Small improvements and bug fix in the Signal API**, [ouroboros-network#4909]\\n* **Improved memory foot-print of tests on ghc-9.8**, [ouroboros-network#4912]\\n* **Error cardano-ping whenever there\'s a decoding error**, [ouroboros-network#4916]\\n\\n### Open-Source contributions\\n\\nWe found out and fixed a bug in the `iproute` parser of `IPv4` addresses:\\n* **Check that IPv4 addresses terminate**, [iproute#63]\\n* **IPv4 address with mask should not contain a white space**, [iproute#64]\\n\\n[sprint-66]: https://github.com/orgs/IntersectMBO/projects/5/views/1?filterQuery=sprint%3A%22Sprint+66%22\\n\\n[ouroboros-network#3311]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/3311\\n[ouroboros-network#4832]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4832\\n[ouroboros-network#4850]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4850\\n[ouroboros-network#4851]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4851\\n[ouroboros-network#4888]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4888\\n[ouroboros-network#4909]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4909\\n[ouroboros-network#4912]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4912\\n[ouroboros-network#4916]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/pull/4916\\n[iproute#63]: https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/iproute/pull/63\\n[iproute#64]: https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/iproute/pull/64"},{"id":"2024-07-19-node-cli-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-07-19-node-cli-api","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-07-19-node-cli-api.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-19-node-cli-api.md","title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 19, 2024","tags":[{"label":"cli-api","permalink":"/tags/cli-api"}],"readingTime":0.475,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos LopezDeLara","title":"Node Product Owner","url":"https://github.com/CarlosLopezDeLara","imageURL":"https://github.com/CarlosLopezDeLara.png","key":"carlos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","slug":"2024-07-19-node-cli-api","authors":"carlos","tags":["cli-api"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Network Team Update","permalink":"/2024-07-19-network"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2024-07-17-hydra"}},"content":"# 2024-07-05 -

In comparison with the latest mainnet release `8.9.3`, we could not observe any regressions. In fact, `8.12.0` was able to deliver equal network\\nperformance at a slightly reduced resource cost - both for CPU and memory.\\n\\nAnother benchmark of the Conway ledger with large amounts of `DRep`s has been performed. This time, 100000 DReps were chosen - this amount aims to simulate a scenario where lots of self-delegation takes place. While a performance\\nimpact is observable in this instance, we can still see that the number of DReps scales well overall, and poses no concern for network peformance.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWe have contributed and merged a performance fix on `8.11` which adresses a regressing metric in the forging loop. The regression was only observable under specific conditions. Benchmarks on `8.12`\\nhave already confirmed the fix to be successful.  \\n \\nWe\'ve kicked off governance action workloads for benchmarking. This will be an entirely new workload type for Conway era, targeting performance measurements of its decentralized decision making process. The workload will feature\\nregistering proposals, acting as multiple DReps to vote on active proposals, vote tallying and proposal enactment. We\'re very grateful for the Ledger team\'s helpful support so far in creating a workload design for benchmarking - one that evenly stresses \\nthe network over extended periods of time.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nThe workbench automations have been upgraded to handle Node `8.12` and the corresponding integrations of Cardano API and CLI.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve updated to the latest PlutusV3 costmodel in our benchmarks - as well as implemented CIP-69 and CIP-117 for all our PlutusV3 benchmarking scripts, pending validation by the Plutus team.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe work on aligning of metrics naming and semantics of new and legacy tracing is ongoing. Additionally, we\'re adding a handful of metrics to the new tracing system which currently exist in legacy tracing only.\\n\\nFactoring out the RTView (\\"real-time view\\") component of `cardano-tracer` in the new tracing system has finished. This includes a considerable refactoring of `cardano-tracer`\'s codebase, so that we\'re currently running test on the new codebase. Isolating\\nRTView is due to its being in prototype stage for too long, and the design decisions taken. In the short term, this will make several package dependencies optional, which have become troublesome for CI, as well as making `cardano-tracer` more lightweight.\\nRTView remains as an opt-in.  \\n\\n### IOI Tech Meetup\\n\\nOur entire team traveled to Zurich, Switzerland to attend ZuriHac\'24 and the IOI Tech Meetup. It was fantastic to meet everyone in person, and we all had an amazing and very productive time. A big Thank You to everyone involved in making that happen, and making it a success.  \\n\\nWe contributed two presentations for the meetup: a thourough introduction of the new tracing system aimed at developers - as it\'s not tailored exclusively to `cardano-node`, but can be used in other (Haskell) services as well. And secondly, \\nan overview over the benchmarking framework based on Quantitative Timeliness Agreements which we\'re building - as well as a show-and-tell of our prototype, implementing part of said framework. We\'re grateful for the great interest and feedback from all\\nthe participants.  \\n\\nLast not least, we worked on creating a community report of the UTxO scaling benchmarks performed during March and April - to be released soon."},{"id":"2024-06-21-node-cli-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-06-21-node-cli-api","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-06-21-node-cli-api.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-21-node-cli-api.md","title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 21, 2024","tags":[{"label":"cli-api","permalink":"/tags/cli-api"}],"readingTime":0.505,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos LopezDeLara","title":"Node Product Owner","url":"https://github.com/CarlosLopezDeLara","imageURL":"https://github.com/CarlosLopezDeLara.png","key":"carlos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","slug":"2024-06-21-node-cli-api","authors":"carlos","tags":["cli-api"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-06-25-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2024-06-19-ledger"}},"content":"# 2024-06-07 - 2024-06-21\\n\\n## High level summary\\n\\nPreparation for cardano-node 8.12\\n\\n### cardano-cli\\n\\n- [Release 8.24.0.0 (for cardano-node-8.12)](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/pull/793)\\n- [Dependency update for the Cardano Node 8.12 release](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/pull/789)\\n- [Update hackage, CHaP; and cardano-api to 8.47.0.0](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/pull/786)\\n- [Future proof against extensions of TxBodyContent](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/pull/785)\\n- [Transaction.hs: reduce boilerplate and move towards ShelleyBasedEra](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/pull/783)\\n\\n### cardano-api\\n\\n- [Release cardano-api-8.48.0.1](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api/pull/563)\\n- [Deserialize `ouroboros-consensus`\'s `PoolDistr` instead of `cardano-ledger`\'s `PoolDist`](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api/pull/562)\\n- [Release cardano-api-8.48.0.0](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api/pull/560)\\n- [evaluateTransactionExecutionUnitsShelley: return logs](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api/pull/555)\\n- [Updated dependencies for the Cardano Node 8.12 release](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api/pull/552)\\n- [Release 8.47.0.0](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api/pull/549)\\n\\n### cardano-node\\n\\n- [Updated dependencies for the Node 8.12](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/5879)\\n\\n### cardano-testnet\\n\\n### docs\\n\\n### CI & project maintenance"},{"id":"2024-06-19-ledger","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-06-19-ledger","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-06-19-ledger.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-19-ledger.md","title":"Ledger Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 19, 2024","tags":[{"label":"ledger","permalink":"/tags/ledger"}],"readingTime":1.37,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey Kuleshevich","title":"Ledger Team Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/lehins","imageURL":"https://github.com/lehins.png","key":"lehins"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","slug":"2024-06-19-ledger","authors":"lehins","tags":["ledger"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","permalink":"/2024-06-21-node-cli-api"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mithril Team Update","permalink":"/2024-06-19-mithril"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nMajor milestone was reached this period.

So far we\'ve found\\nthat the number of `DReps` in ledger scales well and does not lead to notable performance penalties.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve successfully run the baseline for the upcoming `PlutusV3` benchmarks on our Nomad cluster. Those will, given the new V3 cost model, serve to determine headroom, or constraint, regarding resource usage and network metrics when\\noperating under various execution budgets.  \\n\\nLast not least, with much appreciated support and feedback from the network team, we performed a re-evaluation of the network the latency matrix for our benchmarking cluster. The cluster stretches over three regions globally. Due to unknown changes in the underlying\\nhardware infrastructure, a slight delay between Europe and Asia/Pacific regions could be measured. We needed to adjust some existing baselines accordingly - otherwise, this delay could be falsely attributed to a software regression.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWe have implemented a benchmarking workload using `PlutusV3`\'s new BLST internals. As those do little memory allocation, but require more CPU steps, this workload will allow us to focus on that particular aspect of block and transaction budgets.\\n \\n\\nThe `tx-generator` service will now label each submission thread with its submission target. Additionally, it has been equipped with custom signal handlers. This will improve both how gracefully shutdowns can be performed, and how\\nprecise error reporting is done when losing connection to a submission target. Last not least, the service now supports a configurable `KeepAlive` timeout for the `NodeToNode` mini-protocol - accounting for very long major GC pauses on\\nsubmission targets under very specific benchmarking workloads. Those features have entered testing phase.   \\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nThanks to feedback from the consensus team, we\'ve harmonized tracing configurations for our benchmarks between regular and UTxO-HD node. As the latter is more verbose by default, this is a confounding factor for our metrics: We\'re analysing north\\nof 90 traces per second per cluster node, so all node flavours are required to be equally verbose.  \\n\\nThe benchmarks based on the BLST workload now additionally support scaling budget components up or down at will. This means we can run a given cost model against custom execution budgets, controlling the point where the workload will exhaust it. This enables comparison\\nof performance impact of potential changes to those budgets.  \\n\\nPorting our performance workbench\'s profile definitions to Haskell has been nearly completed, and an adequate test suite been implemented. This new component has now entered validation phase to make sure it correctly replicates all existing profile content.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nTwo new metrics for `cardano-node` have landed in `master` - both for new and legacy tracing systems. They provide detailed build info, and indicate wether the node is a block producer or not.  \\n\\nWe\'re now working on closing the gap in the metric naming schema between new and legacy tracing. The aim is to allow for a seamless interchange, without additional configuration required, so that all existing monitoring services can rely on identical metric\\nnames with identical semantics.  \\n\\nFurthermore, work has begun to factor out the RTView (\\"real-time view\\") component of `cardano-tracer` in the new tracing system. Unfortunately, the component has remained in prototype stage for over a year, and has revealed some design shortcomings. It\'s aim\\nis to provide an interactive, real-time dashboard based on metrics from all nodes connected to `cardano-tracer`. The current design has all front-end side code baked into the backend service, requiring to rebuild the entire service in Haskell even for simple changes in the\\ndashboard. We decided to isolate the component in the current code base, which still allows for optionally enabling it for a build. The long term goal however is to convert it into a downstream service: It will ingest metrics by reforwarding, or querying a REST API, and will provide\\na clear separation of frontend facing code. Thus we, and anybody, can use their favourite web technology for visualization of metrics."},{"id":"2024-05-24-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-05-24-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-05-24-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-24-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 24, 2024","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.53,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2024-05-24-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-05-24-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2024-05-22-ledger"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on cardano environment improvements and general\\nenvironment maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n\\n* Sanchonet was respun for cardano-node `8.11.0-pre`\\n\\n* Private chain was respun twice for pre-sancho respin testing and short epoch\\n  testing with cardano-node `8.11.0-pre`\\n\\n* Shelley-qa, two-thirds of preview and one-third of preprod networks were\\n  deployed to cardano-node `8.11.0-pre`\\n\\n* Sanchonet, private chain and shelley-qa networks had dbsync `sancho-4-3-0`\\n  deployed\\n\\n* A dbsync `show_current_forging` prepared statement was added to the\\n  cardano-parts `profile-cardano-postgres` nixosModule to aid with debugging\\n  chain quality issues\\n\\n* Three documents were added to cardano-playground to better explain some\\n  operations procedures: KES rotation, chain quality debugging and new network\\n  creation.

Metrics naming will be further harmonized.\\n* UTxO Growth: We\'ve finalized analysis and reports of all benchmarks targeting UTxO scaling scenarios.\\n* UTxO-HD / LMDB: We\'ve performed multiple runs benchmarking the LMDB (on-disk) backend of UTxO-HD.\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nWe\'ve run and analyzed a full set of benchmarks comparing the Conway ledger against the Babbage one, on Node `8.10.1-pre`. For Conway, our additional goal was to measure a vanilla ledger state against one with a large amount of `DRep`s - and delegations to those `DRep`s - present. The\\nbenchmarks used our existing value and Plutus workloads to remain comparable to each other.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nAdditional ledger queries for the tracing system have been implemented and merged to `master`. Those capture the amount of, and the number\\nof existing delegations to, `DRep`s as trace output - and thus enable creating a metric on top of it, which can then be monitored.\\n\\nThe (in our case) non-deterministic nature of shutting down different cluster setups - both local and cloud-based - carries the possibility\\nthat our transaction generation service occasionally misclassifies a regular shutdown as an error. Furthermore, in the case of network malfunctions, the service\'s errors are too unspecific. By implementing thread labels for submission threads, corresponding to each\\nsubmission target, and by adding custom smart signal handlers, we\'ll improve the generator\'s error reporting significantly.\\n\\nThe initial tests for quick queries are being developed further. We\'re moving towards a principled, and generalized, syntax that supports both\\nprepared, parametrizable queries from the application code, as well as ad-hoc queries stated e.g. on the command line.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nThe performance workbench now fully supports the new `cardano-cli` command `create-test-data`. We use it to inject both stake\\ndelegated to stake pools into genesis, and - recently added - stake delegated to `DRep`s as well. It has been proven very useful\\nand versatile so far, and will eventually replace the current `create-staked` command.  \\n\\nWork on porting our performance workbench\'s profile definitions to Haskell, and providing them with an appropriate test suite, is still ongoing; currently, we\'re integrating all new profile families that came out of the UTxO growth scenarios.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nNew metrics are being implemented for the tracing system. They will also be part of Prometheus output and as such accessible to\\nmonitoring services. There\'ll be `cardano-node`\'s detailed build info, as well as a node\'s block producer status, meaning the presence of forger credentials. Those new metrics are being backported to the legacy tracing system, too.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve determined the need to revisit metrics naming. There\'s still a divergence between naming in the legacy\\nand the new system. While this could be mitigated by passing in extra config options, we think that a transition to the new system\\nshould not impose any unnecessary effort for node operators. A design to fully harmonize the existing naming schemata is currently being\\nset up.\\n\\n### UTxO Growth\\n\\nThe UTxO Growth benchmarking series has been finalized. We\'ve finished analyses and reports for all scenarios that\\nwere tested and explored.   \\n\\nThe overarching questions were, given a network of 32GB host systems, how large can the UTxO set grow in general, \\nhow large can it grow before the nodes have to operate close to the RAM limit over extended periods of time, and how does scaling the UTxO set size affect network metrics, such as block diffusion. \\n\\nA dedicated \\"UTxO Scaling Squad\\" was set up, who was driving the entire process, and we enjoyed a very focused and productive collaboration with them.\\n\\n### UTxO-HD / LMDB\\n\\nLast not least, we were able to benchmark UTxO-HD\'s on-disk backend on a network of block producing nodes, on a recent `8.9.1` version\\nof `cardano-node`. The setup allowed of using a direct access SSD device for performance critical disk I/O, whereas the bulk of ChainDB and ledger snapshots remained on a standard AWS EBS volume.  \\n\\nThe benchmarks comprised both optimistic and pessimistic RAM assumptions for the host OS to further optimize I/O via page cache, as well as medium and large UTxO set sizes - the latter almost tripling current mainnet\'s size. The results were promising; the LMDB backend has proven to be able to accomodate large UTxO sets using significantly less RAM than the default all-in-memory node - and with a more than reasonable trade-off performance-wise. Furthermore, running with pessimistic assumptions, the performance impact on LMDB was very moderate only."},{"id":"2024-05-06-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-05-06-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-05-06-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-06-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"High-level overview of sprint 60","date":"2024-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 6, 2024","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/tags/network"}],"readingTime":2.45,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2024-05-06-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-05-07-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2024-05-03-hydra"}},"content":"## High-level overview of [sprint 60][sprint-60]\\n\\n<small><i>\\nEdited on 8th of May: new EGK counters will be included in\\n`cardano-node-8.9.3`, added links to `cardano-node-8.9.3`\\nPR and `ouroboros-network-0.15`\\nrelease.\\n</i></small>\\n\\n### Peer-Sharing Improvements\\n\\nWe continued working on improving peer sharing.  As part of this work light\\npeer sharing (e.g. including inbound peers to the known set of outbound\\ngovernor), was restructured.  Now, sending more peers than what was requested by\\nthe peer-sharing client is a protocol error, and the connection will be terminated;\\nThis hasn\'t been a resource attack vector since we always limited the number of\\npeers taken by the `outbound-governor` and the number of peers has always been\\nlimited by the size of the mux ingress queue reserved for peer-sharing\\nmini-protocol.  These changes will be released in `cardano-node-8.9.3`.  See\\n[ouroboros-network#4868]\\n\\nWe also merged the work on outbound governor counters, which initially started\\nas just an extension for peer-sharing counters but turned into a larger\\nrefactorisation.  We announced it in the previous report.  These changes will\\nbe included in `8.9.3`.  See [ouroboros-network#4845],\\n[ouroboros-network#4861].\\n\\nLight peer sharing (inbound peers) refactorisation allowed us to refactor the\\ninbound governor loop: we restructured it so that the internal state is kept\\npure (and thus not shared with other threads), while the public part is\\ncomputed incrementally (with good amortised costs and thus leading to good performance) and exposed to other\\ncomponents (e.g. the `outbound-governor`), see [ouroboros-network#4871] \\\\(which\\nis built on top of [ouroboros-network#4868]).\\n\\nThe PR [cardano-nod#5831] integrates `ouroboros-network-0.15` with\\n`cardano-node-8.9.x` branch.  All included PRs / issues in\\n`ouroboros-network-0.15` are listed [here][ouroboros-network-releases].\\n\\n### Genesis\\n\\nWe implemented the API needed by the consensus layer for `Genesis`; see\\n[ouroboros-network#4815], [ouroboros-network#4846]. \\n\\nWe continued working on outbound governor changes to support `Genesis`:\\n\\n* [ouroboros-network#3396]\\n* [ouroboros-network#4813] \\n* [ouroboros-network#4849] \\n\\n### Bootstrap Peers\\n\\nKarl Knutsson ([CF]) found and fixed some problems related to big-ledger and\\npublic root peers.  Here\'s an excerpt from the changelog file:\\n* updated the big-ledger retry state in case of an exception;\\n* reset public root retry state when transitioning between `LedgerStateJudgements`;\\n* reduced public root retry timer;\\n* don\'t classify a config file with public-root/bootstrap-peers IP addresses only\\n  as a DNS error. \\nSee [ouroboros-network#4867].\\n\\n### Churn\\n\\nWe merged a refactorisation which synchronises churn with the outbound\\ngovernor, see [ouroboros-network#4617].\\n\\n## Minor Improvements\\n\\nA few other minor improvements were merged:\\n\\n* updated tools used by `nix`, see [ouroboros-network#4860];\\n* updated pull request template, see [ouroboros-network#4862]\\n\\n### Testing\\n\\nWe added `quickcheck-monoids` package and also submitted an upstream patch to\\n`QuickCheck` to include a version of the standard [`All`] / [`Any`] monoids, which\\nare helpful when writing more complex properties.

Comparing with release `8.9.1`, we could not detect any performance risks for that version. \\n\\nThe benchmarks for `8.10.0` have shown a slight improvement in the time the block forging loop needs to evaluate, whilst additionally, resource usage of the `cardano-node` process was also slightly reduced - a nice performance improvement.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nOur analysis pipeline is based on batch analysis of data from over 50 cluster nodes; it consumes very large amounts of trace output ex post facto, when the actual benchmark has terminated.\\nThis is very time-intensive, and not viable for obeserving an additional metric that you later on determine might need consideration.  \\n\\nWe\'re planning to add quick queries into a benchmarking run\'s trace data to our analysis pipeline. These will be structured such that parameterizable, ad-hoc querying is supported. Initial tests showed that evaluation speed\\nof such queries is fast enough to merit designing a principled, and generalized, syntax for them - and a subsequent implementation.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nThe reporting pipeline has been augmented with direct support for customizable, and stylable, TeX rendering - currently receiving final touches.  \\n\\nPorting our performance workbench\'s profile definitions to Haskell, and providing them with an appropriate test suite, is ongoing work. It is our goal to both increase reliable profile definition and validation, and\\nfacilitate usage by engineers less familiar with the workbench.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe work to improve system metrics as presented to Prometheus is still ongoing. Type annotations, as well as introducing Prometheus labels for certain metrics to convey (like e.g. build information), will make that interface\\nmore versatile. It also facilitates configuration of monitoring or dashboards like Grafana on top of those Prometheus metrics.\\n\\n### UTxO Growth\\n\\nFor the UTxO scaling benchmarks, we\'ve augmented the workbench with the capability to support injection of a custom synthesized chain into the deployment, and start a benchmark only after replaying that chain - whereas\\nour benchmarks usually start just with a genesis block. \\n\\nTo achieve that, different components of our tooling needed addition of features: distributing that chain to the node cluster, having analysis work without necessarily providing trace evidence of each block in the chain being forged by a benchmarking node. Cluster timing had to be adjusted to account for the gap between genesis start time and the chain tip. However, this entire mechanism opens up the possibility of having a very distinct ledger state at hand for a benchmark - one, that\'s been particularly crafted via a series of \\npre-defined transactions constituting the blocks during creation of the synthesized chain.  \\n\\nIn the future, we plan to flesh out a more general design of that mechanism, which currently is tied to a very specific use case only."},{"id":"2024-04-15-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-04-15-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-04-18-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-18-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"High-level overview of sprint 58 and sprint 59","date":"2024-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 18, 2024","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/tags/network"}],"readingTime":3.22,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2024-04-15-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-04-19-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2024-04-17-consensus"}},"content":"## High-level overview of [sprint 58][sprint-58] and [sprint 59][sprint-59]\\n\\n### Releases\\n\\nWe released [`cardano-node-8.9.1`], and we tagged a soon to be released\\n[`cardano-node-8.9.2`]\\nThe `8.9.2` release will have a fixed peer sharing support, which we\\nincidentally broke in `8.9.1`.

This test scenario should prevent us from breaking peer sharing in the\\nfuture in some obvious ways.  In the future, we will also work on extending our\\ntest suite with peer sharing in mind.  See [ouroboros-network#4839],\\n[ouroboros-network#4841].\\n\\n### EKG / Prometheus Counters\\n\\nNote that this is in progress, so some things might still change.\\n\\nWe will provide counters for `active` (also known as `hot`) peers,\\n`established` (e.g. `hot` & `warm`) peers and `known` (e.g. `hot`, `warm` and\\n`cold`) peers.  This is the same way one specifies targets in the node\'s\\nconfiguration.  In addition, the three groups are split into five categories:\\n\\n* ledger peers\\n* big ledger peers\\n* local root peers\\n* bootstrap peers\\n* shared peers\\n\\nIn addition, we also provide a counter for root peers, which counts ledger peers,\\nbig ledger peers, local roots and bootstrap peers, which correspond to the\\nroot peers target `TargetNumberOfRootPeers` in the configuration.\\n\\nWe also provide counters for ongoing promotions and demotions.\\n\\nLedger peers are affected by `TargetNumberOf{Known,Established,Active}Peers` and `TargetNumberOfRootPeers`.\\nThe gap between `TargetNumberOfRootPeers` and `TargetNumberOfKnownPeers` will\\nbe filled either with ledger peers or peers, which the node discovered through\\npeer sharing.\\nBig ledger peers are affected by `TargetNumberOf{Known,Established,Active}BigLedgerPeers`.\\n\\nBelow are some Grafana graphs from an experimental `cardano-node` branch:\\n\\n#### Deprecation policy\\n\\nThe previous `hot`, `warm` / `cold` EKG counters will also be available,\\nalthough deprecated after the new ones are released.

Comparing with release `8.9.0`, we could not detect any performance risks for that version. \\n\\n### Development\\n\\nIn context of UTxO scaling, we want to assess the feasability of the current on-disk solution (which is LMDB) of a UTxO-HD enabled node. Using that, the UTxO set will be kept \\nin live tables and snapshots on disk, significantly reducing memory requirements.  \\n\\nWe\'ve implemented a benchmark setting, and a node service configuration, supporting direct disk access to a dedicated device which can be initialized with optimized\\nfile system and mount settings. It\'s purpose is to serve as storage for the highly performance-critical disk I/O of the LMDB component.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nOur automation for creating all flavours of geneses has seen cleanup and refactoring - which has been merged to `master`. It can now use a more principled, and rigorously checked, modular approach\\nto define, create and cache the desired genesis files.  \\n\\nWorking on integrating new `cardano-cli` functionality in our automation is ongoing. The performance workbench will support a different, and updated, CLI command which will allow injection of `DRep` delegations into genesis.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nBenchmarking `cardano-tracer`\'s new handle registry feature has been performed and evaluated. We\'re satisfied with seeing clear performance improvements along with cleaner code, and much better test coverage.\\nEspecially allocation rate and number of garbage collections (GC) could be significantly reduced, along with the CPU time required for performing GCs. This will allow for higher trace message throughput given\\nidentiacal system resources - plus less system calls issued to the OS in the process.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the new tracing system is getting improvements for its Prometheus output - like providing version numbers as metrics, or annotating metrics with their type - enhancing the output\'s overall utility.\\n\\n### UTxO Growth\\n\\nThe performance workbench now supports profiles aimed at simulating UTxO growth both for a single node and an entire cluster. Additionally, simulating different\\nRAM sizes in combination with specific UTxO set sizes is supported. For a single block producing node, the focus is on quick turnaround when running\\na benchmark, gaining insight into the node\'s RAM usage and possible impact on the forging loop.  \\n\\nThe cluster profiles enable capturing block diffusion metrics as well, however they require a much longer runtime. We can now successfully benchmark the node\'s behaviour\\nwhen dealing with UTxO set sizes 4x - 5x of current mainnet, as well as a possible change in behaviour when operating close to phsyical RAM limit due to that.\\n\\n### Nomad cluster\\n\\nOur backend now supports allocating and deploying Nomad jobs for multiple clusters simultaneously - all while keeping existing automations operational. We\'ve taken special precautions\\na cluster, as seen by the backend, can be efficiently and easily modified to reflect newly deployed, or changed, hardware. Additionally, we\'ve added support for host volumes inside a Nomad\\nallocation - which will be needed for benchmarking UTxO-HD\'s on-disk solution."},{"id":"2024-03-22-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-03-22-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-03-22-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-22-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High-level summary","date":"2024-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 22, 2024","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":0.895,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Hydra Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2024-03-22-hydra","authors":["ch1bo"],"tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-03-27-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2024-03-20-consensus"}},"content":"### High-level summary\\n\\nThis week, the Hydra team restored test compatibility with all networks, reviewed and merged streaming plugins contributed by SundaeLabs.

This requires changes\\nin the topology file as well as `cardano-node` & `ouroboros-network` to\\nunderstand the snapshots; and on the other hand creation of such snapshots by\\n`cardano-cli`.\\n\\n## Low-level summary\\n\\nThis time everything was _high-level_, :wink:.\\n\\n[sprint-57]: https://github.com/orgs/IntersectMBO/projects/5/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Labels%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Status%22%2C%22Linked+pull+requests%22%2C69151865%2C%22Repository%22%5D&filterQuery=sprint%3A%22Sprint+57%22\\n\\n[CF]: https://cardanofoundation.org\\n\\n[`cardano-node-8.9.0`]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/8.9.0\\n[ouroboros-network-releases]: https://github.com/orgs/IntersectMBO/projects/5/views/18\\n\\n[ouroboros-network#3311]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/3311\\n[ouroboros-network#4555]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4555\\n[ouroboros-network#4778]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4778\\n[ouroboros-network#4788]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4788\\n[ouroboros-network#4793]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4793\\n[ouroboros-network#4794]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4794\\n[ouroboros-network#4799]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4799\\n[ouroboros-network#4800]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4800\\n[ouroboros-network#4810]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4810\\n[ouroboros-network#4832]: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/issues/4832"},{"id":"2024-03-15-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-03-15-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-03-15-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-15-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High-level summary","date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 15, 2024","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":1.38,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Hydra Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2024-03-15-hydra","authors":["ch1bo"],"tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Network Team Update","permalink":"/2024-03-18-network"},"nextItem":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","permalink":"/2024-03-15-node-cli-api"}},"content":"### High-level summary\\n\\nThis week, the Hydra team worked on aligning the specification with the current\\nincremental decommit implementation, added decommit to model-based tests and\\nalso discussed the incremental commit protocol extension with researchers.

Initially, we identified a performance regression in connection to ledger snapshots. This has been addressed very swiftly.\\nHaving re-run the fixed version, we could detect no performance risks in comparison with `8.7.2` / `8.7.3`.  \\n\\nIn an additional set of benchmarks, we targeted the garbage collector (GC) settings that `cardano-node` is built with by default. Specifically, we compared these (copying, sequential GC) as a baseline\\nto using the parallel GC, the compacting GC and the non-moving GC - all of which are supported by GHC\'s runtime system. As GC always is a trade-off between space and time (and as a consequence, responsiveness);\\nwe could measure the parallel GC offering a slight increase in responsiveness at the cost of delaying some evaluations - which is suboptimal for a block forger. The compacting GC could clearly\\nachieve a smaller RAM footprint, but only at the cost of increased CPU usage - and clearly worsened responsiveness. The non-moving GC could greatly enhance responsiveness - but increased the RAM footprint tremendously, as\\nwell as introduced delays in the forging loop. In conclusion: the existing default is still the best choice by far for `cardano-node` - validated both on GHC8.10.7 and GHC9.6.3.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\n\\nThe work on moving benchmark profile, and genesis, definitions out of the `bash` scripting / JSON data transformation space is still ongoing. Type safety and a test suite for those tasks\\nwill allow for a much more principled approach.  \\n\\nThe implementation of additional rendering formats and report templates for our reporting pipeline has been completed; it is currently in testing and validation phase.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nWe\'re working on integrating new `cardano-cli` functionality in our automations. Injecting `DRep` delegations into genesis - for Conway ledger benchmarks - will require us\\nto use a new CLI command, which differs in in output structure and options provided from the one we\'re using to inject stake pool delegations. This requires us to\\nimplement and additional post-processing step for backends to find everything as expected.\\n\\nFurthermore, a PR has been merged which refactors and cleans up benchmarking profiles, with a focus on fine-tuning solo-node benchmarks which scrutinize a single `cardano-node` process.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe test suite for `cardano-tracer`\'s new handle registry feature is complete, and the new feature passes all tests. At the moment, we\'re\\npreparing it for merging into `master`.\\n\\n### UTxO Growth\\n\\nWe\'re developing a series of benchmarks that will provide insight into possible changes to the Node\'s performance characteristics given different UTxO set sizes and numbers of delegated wallets.\\nWhat we aim to capture in these benchmarks is the system\'s capability to scale with UTxO growth - while simultaneously evaluating hardware requirements. The workloads will be based on existing release benchmarks, but allow for flexibility regarding UTxO set and delegations. They will target the existing in-memory solution, and at the same time permit feasability testing UTxO-HD\'s on-disk\\nflavour - which does not keep the entire UTxO set in RAM permanently.\\n\\n### Nomad cluster\\n\\nImplementation of cluster machine disk space checking and garbage collection is complete. A requirement was that no\\nmonitoring process interferes with a running benchmark, so a non-synchronous approach was chosen to guarantee enough disk space. This prevents failing\\nruns, and thus the necessity to repeat them.  \\n\\nIn the process, the workbench backend was equipped with a wider range of cluster commands and abstractions, which makes administrating cluster\\nmachines more flexible. This includes a new service to create a network latency matrix for deployed cluster hardware - generalizing the approach\\nchosen during the Nomad cluster\'s initial validation phase. This can guarantee the validity of existing baselines in case of hardware reboots, or changes\\nin topology.  \\n\\nLast not least, the backend is currently receiving an additional feature: supporting more than 1 hardware cluster. This will enable us,\\nin the future, to benchmark on ephemeral clusters - without interfering with the hard requirements, or the schedule, of release benchmarking\\non our default deployment. The motivation is being able to benchmark different hardware configurations, along with varying `cardano-node` options and\\ninitial ledger states on a parallel schedule - also, without having to keep those clusters running at all times."},{"id":"2024-03-06-consensus","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-03-06-consensus","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-03-06-consensus.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-06-consensus.md","title":"Consensus Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 6, 2024","tags":[{"label":"consensus","permalink":"/tags/consensus"}],"readingTime":0.675,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Nadales","title":"Consensus Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/dnadales","imageURL":"https://github.com/dnadales.png","key":"dnadales"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","slug":"2024-03-06-consensus","authors":"dnadales","tags":["consensus"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-03-08-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mithril Team Update","permalink":"/2024-03-06-mithril"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\n- Completed the rebase of the production libraries for UTXO-HD on 8.9, both in `ouroboros-consensus`, `cardano-api` and `cardano-node`.\\n- Measured sync and replay times and memory in UTXO-HD.

Comparing with release `8.7.2`, we could\\nnot detect any performance risks for that version. We even saw a slight improvement in block fetch related metrics, which led to slightly improved block diffusion times.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve managed to boil down a complex residual performance issue measured on the cluster to a local reproduction. This enables our DevX team, with highly specialized knowledge of GHC\'s compiler internals, to \\ninvestigate each step in code generation and optimzation, and independently observe the effects of code changes to the affected component.\\n\\n### Performance\\n\\nWork on the remaining performance issue with GHC9.6 led us to produce two candidates based on Node `8.7.2`, benchmarking\\nthe implacations local small changes have for GHC9.6\'s optimizer. Though those candidates did not uncover the\\nissue\'s root cause, they were able to disprove a hypothesis as to its nature, and quantify the performance impact of said small changes.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nNode `8.8.0` comes with capabilities to inject `DRep`s and `DRep` delegations into Conway genesis. We\'ve started work\\non integrating those into our automations, and setting sensible values for benchmarking. The aforementioned\\ndelegations representing a new data structure in the Conway ledger, we aim to run\\nexisting workflows extended with varying sizes of that new structure, measuring their pressure on ledger queries and operations.\\n\\n### Workbench\\n\\nThe performance workbench relies heavily on shell scripting and manipulating JSON data for a great part of its features. This approach\\nis very effective for quick experimentation, but lacks in verifiable properties as well as accessibility for new users of workbench.\\n\\nAfter the successful Haskell port of cluster topology creation, and verification, we\'re currently applying\\nthe same model in porting the entirety of benchmarking profiles to Haskell. The obvious gains are widening workbench\'s\\naudience both for users and developers, as well as implementing a principled approach to all workbench data structures and transformations.  \\n\\nAt the same time, we\'re porting workbench\'s many options to create fine-tuned geneses, following the same approach.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nWe\'ve outfitted `cardano-tracer` with a handle registry feature that lets the service work on file handles internally, rather than opening and closing files for each operation. The feature is completed; at the moment we\'re adding\\nappropriate test cases to the service\'s test suite for validation of its behaviour, and for safeguarding future development.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nSeveral improvements for our cluster backend have been merged to `master`, increasing its overall robustness. We can now safely handle some corner cases where Nomad processes unexpectedly exited, or deployments errored out. Furthermore, an ongoing\\nrun can now reliably survive a temporary loss of heartbeat connection between Nomad client and server, without\\nthe benchmarking metrics being affected.  \\n\\nCurrently, we\'re working on a reliable automation of garbage collecting old `nix` store entries on the cluster machines, as they fill up disk space. The design has to consider both not interfering with ongoing benchmarks, and\\navoiding deployment overhead caused by cleaning the store too frequently."},{"id":"2024-02-16-sre","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-02-16-sre","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-02-16-sre.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-16-sre.md","title":"SRE Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 16, 2024","tags":[{"label":"sre","permalink":"/tags/sre"}],"readingTime":1.03,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"John Lotoski","title":"Service Reliability Engineer","url":"https://github.com/johnalotoski","imageURL":"https://github.com/johnalotoski.png","key":"johnalotoski"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SRE Team Update","slug":"2024-02-16-sre","authors":"johnalotoski","tags":["sre"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-02-16-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","permalink":"/2024-02-15-node-cli-api"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe SRE team continues work on cardano environment improvements and general\\nenvironment maintenance.\\n\\nSome notable recent changes, updates or improvements include:\\n* Sanchonet state was respun from slot 14255995 for cardano-node 8.8.0-pre\\n* Cardano node 8.8.0-pre is now deployed to sanchonet, shelley-qa, two-thirds\\n  of preprod and one-third of preview networks\\n* IOG pool block producers are now signing mithril certificates for preview,\\n  preprod and mainnet networks\\n* A cardano performance dashboard is now available for both playground and\\n  cardano-mainnet deployments\\n\\n## Lower level summary\\n\\n### Cardano-mainnet\\n* Adds mithril signers and perf dashboard to the mainnet cluster; improves\\n  network docs, tunes alerts, plus misc fixes:\\n  [cardano-mainnet-pull-8](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-mainnet/pull/8)\\n\\n### Cardano-parts\\n* Adds mithril signer capability to role-block-producer nixosModule, adds a\\n  profile-mithril-relay nixosModule and includes misc other improvements and\\n  fixes:\\n  [cardano-parts-pull-31](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts/pull/31)\\n\\n* Updates packages for sanchonet respin, adds a node performance dashboard\\n  template and fixes misc issues:\\n  [cardano-parts-pull-32](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-parts/pull/32)\\n\\n### Cardano-parts\\n* Adds mithril signers and mithril relays to preview and preprod networks and\\n  includes misc other improvements and fixes:\\n  [cardano-playground-pull-15](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-playground/pull/15)\\n\\n* Updates machines and pin for sanchonet respin, adds a node performance\\n  dashboard and fixes misc issues:\\n  [cardano-playground-pull-16](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-playground/pull/16)\\n\\n### Iohk-nix\\n* Updates conway-genesis for node 8.8.0-pre:\\n  [iohk-nix-pull-571](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/pull/571)\\n\\n* Updates useLedgerAfterSlot for respin of sanchonet:\\n  [iohk-nix-pull-572](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/pull/572)"},{"id":"2024-02-15-node-cli-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-02-15-node-cli-api","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-02-15-node-cli-api.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-15-node-cli-api.md","title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 15, 2024","tags":[{"label":"cli-api","permalink":"/tags/cli-api"}],"readingTime":1.01,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos LopezDeLara","title":"Node Product Owner","url":"https://github.com/CarlosLopezDeLara","imageURL":"https://github.com/CarlosLopezDeLara.png","key":"carlos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","slug":"2024-02-15-node-cli-api","authors":"carlos","tags":["cli-api"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"SRE Team Update","permalink":"/2024-02-16-sre"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2024-02-14-ledger"}},"content":"# 2024-02-01 - 2024-02-15\\n\\n## High level summary\\n\\n- cardano-cli: Added the \'immutable\' tip parameter to conway queries that allow the user to query either the current volatile tip (default) or the immutable tip.

For recommending GHC9.6 as a default build platform for `cardano-node` - from a performance perspective - we observe only one residual issue. As a way to\\naddress this, we\'ve decided to create a reproduction benchmark targeting the affected component.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nOur reporting pipeline will be expanded to support a wider range of rendering formats, as well as report templates. As the pipeline is part of our workbench - and thus gets downloaded and built when entering the workbench shell - it\'s \\ngood practice to keep a small dependency footprint. When reworking the pipeline, we aim to simultaneously reduce dependencies.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nSo far, `cardano-tracer` has internally been using files, or file names, for the purpose of logging trace messages it receives via forwarding. This is simple, but induces quite some overhead at runtime: files have to be opened and closed for each message.\\nUsing and managing open file handles inside `cardano-tracer` does remove that overhead, but unsurprisingly introduces some complexity into the application code. Currently, we\'re working on implementing that change.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we\'re working on a Quickstart document for the new tracing system, with end users as its intended audience. It will contain recommended production use setup(s), and how to efficiently configure and run them step by step. Additionally, it\\nwill provide a brief, but comprehensive overview over the features at the user\'s disposal.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nOn the Nomad cluster, we\'ve experienced undesired system behaviour when the heartbeat between the Nomad server and a client is interrupted temporarily - although the Nomad job itself is still 100% functional. A Nomad\\nupgrade to the latest version promises to fix that, but it turn comes with other issues. We\'re currently working on adapting our automation and deployment around those known issues, before we can eventually\\napply the upgrade."},{"id":"2024-01-30-db-sync","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-01-30-db-sync","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-01-30-db-sync.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-30-db-sync.md","title":"DB Sync Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2024-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 30, 2024","tags":[{"label":"db-sync","permalink":"/tags/db-sync"}],"readingTime":0.395,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Dermentzis","title":"Cardano DB-Sync Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/kderme","imageURL":"https://github.com/kderme.png","key":"kderme"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"DB Sync Team Update","slug":"2024-01-30-db-sync","authors":"kderme","tags":["db-sync"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2024-01-31-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2024-01-26-hydra"}},"content":"## High level summary\\nThe DBSync team has prepared and tested a new db-sync version for mainnet, we have continued our\\nintegration and update for Conway and have extended its modularity.\\n\\n## Lower level summary\\n- We attempt to turn db-sync into a modular project that can run with wither low or high recourses\\n[#1610](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1610)\\n[#1613](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1613)\\n[#1590](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1590)\\n\\n- Moving the flags above to a config file\\n[#1609](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1609)\\n\\n- Optimizations\\n[#1595](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1595)\\n[#1607](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1607)\\n\\n- Conway Support and updates\\n[#1581](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1581)\\n[#1573](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1573)\\n[#1570](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/pull/1570)"},{"id":"2024-01-26-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024-01-26-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2024-01-26-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-26-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High-level Summary","date":"2024-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 26, 2024","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":0.75,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Hydra Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2024-01-26-hydra","authors":["ch1bo"],"tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"DB Sync Team Update","permalink":"/2024-01-30-db-sync"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2024-01-24-consensus"}},"content":"### High-level Summary\\n\\nThis week, the Hydra team conducted yearly roadmapping sessions, introduced a\\nbreaking API change to eliminate JSON encoding of transactions (refer to issue\\n#1213 for details), completed off-chain logic for incremental decommits through,\\nand implemented a hydra-explorer backend.\\n\\n### What did the team achieve this week\\n\\n-   Conducted yearly roadmapping sessions\\n-   Merged a breaking API change to drop JSON encoding of transactions [#1213](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1213) -

Such regressions are very important to us since they can lead to lost\\nblocks.  We were able to reproduce this issue.  Every time there\'s a longer\\npause of block production (due to the statistical nature of Ouroboros), there\\nis a chance that the bug will be armed.  For this reason `cardano-node-8.7.2`\\nneeds to be closely monitored.\\n\\nWe found the bug and developed a fix, [ref][ouroboros-network#4748].  Karl\\nKntusson ([CF]) wasn\'t able to reproduce the bug with the patched version of\\nthe node for long enough (almost two weeks now) for us to belive that the fix\\nis correct.  \\n\\n### Advise for SPOs\\n\\nWe created a [release branch for `8.7.3`][cardano-node-8.7.3].  The advice from\\nthe *network team* is to either downgrade to the previous release, e.g. `8.1.2`\\nor use the above release branch (note that there were no benchmarks made or Q&A\\ntests yet).\\n\\n### Testing plans\\n\\nWe were also able to reproduce the bug using `IOSim`, [ouroboros-network#4757].\\nHowever, the bug relies on a particular schedule of two threads which are\\ninvolved and we needed to artificailly modify `IOSim` schedule in production\\ncode - something that we don\'t want to commit to the `master` branch.  We also\\nexperimented with a randomised scheduler for `IOSim`, but that did not lead to\\nfinding the schedule which arms the bug: the search space grows exponentially\\nwith the number of steps in the threads, partial order reduction techniques\\nimplemented in `IOSimPOR` are more appropriate - unfortunatelly the simulation\\ntest is too large to be executed in `IOSimPOR` even with large amounts of\\n`RAM`.  To use `IOSimPOR` we need to implement a test which includes the two\\ninteracting components:\\n\\n* `connection-manager`\\n* `outbound-governor` (where the bug was located)\\n\\nwhich communicate through `PeerStateActions`, without including all the\\ndiffusion components as we do in our [sim-net] tests.  More in style of\\n`outbound-governor` tests where there is just a single `outbound-governor`,\\nunlike in the [sim-net] which runs multiple communicating diffusions.\\n\\n### Bootstrap peers\\n\\nWe continued working on bootstrap peers, [ouroboros-network#4555]\\n\\n### TxSubmission Decision Logic\\n\\nWe continued working on tx-submission decision logic, [ouroboros-network#3311]\\n\\n\\n[CF]:

Additionally, we\'ve added a feature to `cardano-tracer` to capture performance over a long runtime.\\n* Nomad cluster: The Nomad backend has been successfully equipped with support for up-to-date P2P topology, as well as deployment for Plutus script data.\\n\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nWe\'ve performed a full set of release benchmarks for node `8.7.2`. From a performance perspective, it has been greenlit for mainnet release. Starting with this version, our team will publish observations alongside the original comparative analysis of benchmarks, providing insight into key metrics and resource usage. Hence, for the post on version `8.7.2`, see [here](/reports/2023-12-performance-8.7.2).\\n\\nAdditionally, we\'re running P2P versus no-P2P benchmarks on the same version. We intend to establish future baseline runs using P2P topology as the default setting. All our cluster nodes being block producers, it is crucial to establish the P2P stack does not exhibit any regression regarding block forging. Furthermore, the evidence gathered from those benchmarks forms the base for a recommended setting for P2P on mainnet block producers.  \\n\\nIt deserves special mention that those P2P benchmarks are our first production runs with the Nomad cluster - and using the new tracing system exclusively. Having finalized all optimization rounds of the latter, and having meticulously eliminated all confounding factors from the Nomad infrastructure, we\'re confident in the measurements being subject to extremely low variance - which we made sure of in many past validation runs on Nomad.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\n\\nOrchestrating `DRep` actions into benchmarking workflows has opened up a fairly large design space. Currently, we\'re focusing on having stake delegated to `DRep`s, in order to trigger ledger pulses for calculations particular to `DRep` actions. We can benchmark a possible\\nperformance impact of those pulses - even if there are no actions ongoing -  as a first step.  \\n\\nThe contributing factors to the cost of those pulses are both the number of `DRep`s registered, and the number of delegations to them. It is still under debate which values represent a probable model for mainnet, and whether we can achieve stake delegation programmatically (i.e. by submitting transactions), or if, for large numbers, we need means to inject those delegations into genesis.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nWith the switch of all production benchmarks to the Nomad cluster, we will retire the legacy `cardano-ops` cluster very shortly. Currently, we\'re making sure that when all its resources are released, we keep an archive for all runs performed, including all raw log data - with the oldest runs dating back as far as December 2019.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nWe\'ve outfitted the `cardano-tracer` service with the same kind of resource tracing machinery that\'s used by `cardano-node` - as well as created a dedicated benchmarking profile for it. It puts very little pressure on the node; instead it causes 6 nodes to emit traces at a rate of >35 messages per second, putting pressure on `cardano-tracer` via trace forwarding at >200 messages per second for an extended period of time. Analysis of these traces will form the ground for various optimizations of `cardano-tracer` that are currently being worked on.  \\n\\nAs we aim for early 2024 to be able to recommend the new tracing system as default in production use, we\'re currently also reworking the comprehensive documentation to reflect all changes made over the last months.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nIn addition to being able to deploy Plutus script data and redeemers seperately (instead of inlining them as the legacy cluster did), the Nomad cluster now supports being set up with recent P2P topology. No-P2P topology format will still be supported\\nfor occasional regression benchmarking of the P2P stack, when desired. Furthermore, we\'ve completed porting all benchmarking profiles from the legacy cluster to Nomad."},{"id":"2023-12-08-goedel","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-12-08-goedel","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-12-08-goedel.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-08-goedel.md","title":"Goedel Team Update","description":"The team works on applied research and consulting in formal methods","date":"2023-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"goedel","permalink":"/tags/goedel"}],"readingTime":0.385,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"James Chapman","title":"Head of Formal Methods","url":"https://github.com/jmchapman","imageURL":"https://github.com/jmchapman.png","key":"jmchapman"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","slug":"2023-12-08-goedel","authors":"jmchapman","tags":["goedel"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2023-12-11-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Network Team Update","permalink":"/2023-12-08-network"}},"content":"The team works on applied research and consulting in formal methods\\nthat is directly applicable to evidence based engineering in Core Tech\\nand beyond.\\n\\n## High level summary\\n\\nThe team is currently formalising mini protocols, working on a\\nperformance modelling paper and working on a performance modelling\\nprototype tool\\n\\n## Details\\n\\n* completing work on chain sync mini-protocol\\n\\n* proof sketch of conformance property of chain sync mini-protocol\\n\\n* new content for JLAMP paper\\n\\n* NWPT talk"},{"id":"2023-12-08-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-12-08-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-12-08-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-08-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"High-level overview of sprint 49 & sprint 50","date":"2023-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/tags/network"}],"readingTime":2.445,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2023-12-08-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","permalink":"/2023-12-08-goedel"},"nextItem":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","permalink":"/2023-12-08-node-cli-api"}},"content":"## High-level overview of [sprint 49][sprint-49] & [sprint 50][sprint-50]\\n\\n### Fixed PeerSelection bug\\n\\nKarl Knutsson ([Cardano Foundation (CF)][CF]) found a bug in\\nthe `cardano-node-8.7.0` version used on the Sancho Net which was fixed in `8.7.1`.\\nIt resulted in a node not being able to reconnect to an upstream peer once it\\nwas demoted by an asynchronous exception.  This bug would be caught by Q&A in\\na mainet release, but for testnet releases, Q&A test suite is not used. We also\\ndeveloped a test which covers the bug in the `ouroboros-network`, we also identified\\na missing `PeerSelection` test which we need to port to our simulation network.\\nSee [ouroboros-network#4734], [ouroboros-network#4665].\\n\\n### Bootstrap Peers\\n\\nStill under review, [ouroboros-network#4555].  The consensus team is now\\nimplementing the API we need for bootstrap peers.  Once consensus API is implemented we will integrate changes in an experimental branch of\\n`cardano-node`.\\n\\n### Tx-Submission\\n\\nWe started working on a new implementation of the tx-submission application.  No\\n`tx-submission` protocol changes are foreseen, but we want to be able to\\ndownload each `tx` from just one upstream peer and share the results between\\ndifferent connections.  We want to distribute the bandwidth between multiple\\nclients.  We also think that this work will prepare us for the future\\nOuroboros-Leios changes, which will contain various versions of `tx-submission`\\nlike mini-protocols. See [ouroboros-network#4701].\\n\\n## Peer Sharing\\n\\nVarious fixes and improvements were implemented:\\n\\n* [ouroboros-network#4725]\\n    * disabled peer sharing with initiator-only nodes: currently it\'s not\\n      possible to get peers from initiator-only nodes (edge nodes, e.g.\\n      wallets).  In the future, we might change this, which will require running\\n      a server-side of the `peer-sharing` protocol by such nodes. See\\n      [ouroboros-network#4726].\\n    * fixed `peer-sharing` codec\\n    * fixed a handshake bug which returned a wrong peer-sharing option\\n* [ouroboros-network#4728]\\n    * disabled `peer-sharing` for `NodeToNodeV_11` and `NodeToNodeV_12`\\n\\n* Karl Knutsson ([CF]) has been working on additional improvements, e.g. [ouroboros-network#4735]\\n\\nWith these fixes, Karl Knutsson ([CF]) was able to see that two peers on the mainnet\\ncan discover themselves through `peer-sharing` and keep being mutually useful\\nand thus the connection surviving `outbound-governor` churn events.\\n\\n### IOSim\\n\\nWe improved the memory footprint of `IOSim` in [io-sim#126], see\\n[ouroboros-network#4721] for heap profile improvements on large test cases.\\n\\nWe are working on optimising the memory footprint of `IOSimPOR`.  We are\\nreimplementing `VectorClocks` using a trie, instead of a map which leads to\\nsignificant improvements.\\n\\n### Cardano-Ping\\n\\n`cardano-node-0.2.0.10` was released to `CHaP`, [ouroboros-network#4746].  This\\nversion exports more APIs which turned out to be useful in `cardano-node` test\\nsuite, see [cardano-node#5536].\\n\\n### Technical Debt\\n\\nWe addressed some small tech-debt issues in [ouroboros-network#4722]:\\n* fixed some typos\\n* using `bracket` instead of `onException` in `withSnocket`\\n* improved haddocks\\n* organised `TracePeerSelection` constructors\\n\\nWe improved the memory footprint of some of our tests in [ouroboros-network#4721].\\n\\n[CF]: https://cardanofoundation.org\\n[cardano-node#5536]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/5536\\n[io-sim#126]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/126\\n[ouroboros-network#4555]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4555\\n[ouroboros-network#4665]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4665\\n[ouroboros-network#4701]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4701\\n[ouroboros-network#4721]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4722\\n[ouroboros-network#4722]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4722\\n[ouroboros-network#4725]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4725\\n[ouroboros-network#4726]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4726\\n[ouroboros-network#4728]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4728\\n[ouroboros-network#4734]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4734\\n[ouroboros-network#4735]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4735\\n[ouroboros-network#4746]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4746\\n[sprint-49]: https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/19/views/16?filterQuery=sprint%3A%22sprint+49%22\\n[sprint-50]: https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/19/views/16?filterQuery=sprint%3A%22sprint+50%22"},{"id":"2023-12-08-node-cli-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-12-08-node-cli-api","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-12-08-node-cli-api.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-08-node-cli-api.md","title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"cli-api","permalink":"/tags/cli-api"}],"readingTime":2.2,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos LopezDeLara","title":"Node Product Owner","url":"https://github.com/CarlosLopezDeLara","imageURL":"https://github.com/CarlosLopezDeLara.png","key":"carlos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","slug":"2023-12-08-node-cli-api","authors":"carlos","tags":["cli-api"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Network Team Update","permalink":"/2023-12-08-network"},"nextItem":{"title":"SRE Team Update","permalink":"/2023-12-08-sre"}},"content":"# 2023-11-15 - 2023-12-08\\n\\n## High level summary\\n\\nThis is sprint was mostly about bug fixing, code clean-ups and optimizations in preparation for a mainnet suitable release.\\n\\n### cardano-cli\\n\\n- [Unify previous governance action parameters across actions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/511)\\n- [Release 8.17.0.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/510)\\n- [ Restore the inclusion of datum hashes in Alonzo era tx bodies](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/507)\\n- [create-staked: add test](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/498)\\n- [create-staked: simplify some code](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/497)\\n- [Remove unused cabal file code](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/495)\\n- [New version cardano-cli-8.16.0.1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/491)\\n- [Fix era mismatch error in stake-address-info](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/490)\\n- [Release 8.16.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/489)\\n- [Add create-testnet-data command](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/488)\\n- [Rename stake-address-info field: stakeDelegation -> delegation for eras prior to Conway](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/487)\\n- [Update the `--key-output-format` help text: default is text-envelope](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/486)\\n- [Complete help texts for `create-protocol-parameters-update`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/484)\\n- [Fix using queryStakeVoteDelegatees in eras before conway](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli/pull/483)\\n- [Use node queries with tighter eons.

We\'ve measured slight performance improvements of `8.7.0` over `8.6.0`, and can confirm no regressions have been introduced.\\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve run system integration level benchmarks in the Conway era for the first time, on the same node version.\\nOnly Babbage-compatible workloads have entered comparison as to ascertain performance consequences of only changing the ledger version, and nothing else. The results are very promising, as we could show that switching ledger versions for existing workloads does not come with a performance penalty.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nOur transaction generator has been extended to be able to submit all present benchmarking workflows in the Conway era.\\nCurrently, we\'re looking into adding Conway-exclusive features, such as `DRep` registration. Those would be submitted at the very beginning of a run, as we\'re interested in seeing potential performance implications of maintaining `DRep` sets of varying size in ledger. Furthermore, this will serve as the basis for future development Conway-exclusive workloads, such as governance actions or vote tallying.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nAs our workbench will be pivotal in orchestrating and organizing benchmarking runs on the Nomad cloud backend, we\'ve\\nimproved how raw benchmark data is tagged, which metadata is documented in an automated manner. This enhances both access to existing run sets, as well as maintaining an archive for benchmarking data.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe new tracing system is currently receiving usability improvements as we\'re reworking the output of several trace messages.\\nAdditionally, we\'re setting up a rigorous test suite to provide safety for future development of and component integration inte the system.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nWe\'ve been working on adapting various benchmarking workloads, which are defined by our workbench\'s profiles, to running on the new infrastructure. This mainly concerns a workload utilizing Plutus, as well as peer-to-peer flavoured workloads. Furthermore, we\'re implementing a solution to create all possible cluster topologies algorithmically, instead of still using fixed literal definitions for some cases."},{"id":"2023-12-01-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-12-01-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-12-01-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-01-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High-level summary","date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":0.865,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Hydra Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2023-12-01-hydra","authors":["ch1bo"],"tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2023-12-04-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2023-11-29-consensus"}},"content":"### High-level summary\\n\\nThis week, the Hydra team conducted a packed Monthly Review meeting,\\nfeaturing demonstrations and the preparation of the monthly report.

We summarise the analysis and our responses here.\\n\\n## Initial CIP-1694 Security Analysis and Responses\\n\\n### Section: The constitutional committee\\n\\n---\\n\\n- \u201cFor example, if we consider the hypothetical Constitution rule \\"The Cardano network must always be able to produce new blocks\\" - In this example, if the governance action to reduce block size to 0 is passed, then there will be no way of passing or enacting further proposals. That is, this governance action is completely non-reversable. Suggestion: Instating a built-in mechanism that checks (and perhaps enforces) that the proposed governance actions, if passed, can be reverted in the future.\\n\\nThere is a \'guardrails document\' in preparation which captures issues such as these.  Some of them may be automatable, as suggested; others will need to be evaluated by humans.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Size of the constitutional committee\\n\\n---\\n\\n- A possible issue with very large committee sizes (or large number of proposals/voters in general) is that it may take longer to have votes appear on-chain, which in extreme cases may require longer voting periods.\\n\\nThanks. Yes, we\u2019ve been thinking about this issue for a long time, see for example the section \u2018Final safety measure, post bootstrapping\u2019. We don\u2019t consider this as an issue for the CC since they need to be elected while DReps can just register, so we expect the number of CC members to be much less than the number of DReps\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Terms\\n\\n---\\n\\n- The following sentence is a bit awkward to read: \u201cFor example, a committee of size five with a threshold of 3/5 a minimum size of three and two expired members can still pass governance actions if two non-expired members vote Yes.\u201d \u2014> Suggestion: \u201cFor example, if we have a committee of size five with a threshold of 3/5, then a committee of three non-expired and two expired members can still pass governance actions if two non-expired members vote Yes.\u201d \\n\\nThanks. Yes, that suggestion is a bit easier to read.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Registered DReps\\n\\n---\\n\\n- \u201cAdditionally, registered DReps will need to vote regularly to still be considered active.\u201d - There is a minor issue with requiring \u201cvoting regularly\u201d. That is, if there are no proposals to vote on for a long time, this means that no DRep can vote regularly (or they have to issue bogus proposals just to vote on them).\\n\\nThanks. We\u2019ve added a mechanism to prevent that issue in the spec/code where if there\u2019s nothing to vote on for an entire epoch, we increment the epoch that each DRep expires.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Ratification\\n\\n---\\n\\n- It is a bit unclear why protocol changes: network group and technical group are two separate groups.\\n \\nThese correspond exactly to the groups that are administered by the Parameter Committee.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- I didn\u2019t understand the rationale for requiring 100% \u201cYes\u201d votes to pass \u201cInfo\u201d type governance actions? It seems they have the least potential to harm the system.\\n\\nYes, it\u2019s not about harming the system, since `Info` \\nactions have no direct effect on the operation of Cardano. The motivation is simply to record the actual level of support for the action. \\n\\nOnce an action is enacted it\u2019s no longer possible to vote on it. So if there was e.g. a threshold of 50%, then there is no way of telling whether the support for it might eventually have reached 90% or higher if it was not immediately enacted when the threshold was reached.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Content\\n\\n---\\n\\n- For Hard-fork initiation, the changed parameters should probably also be required as part of Additional data.\\n\\nProtocol parameters can be changed in arbitrary ways by the hard fork and new ones might be introduced, so anything this action pins down might not actually be the value that will be present after the hard fork.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Protocol Parameter groups\\n\\n---\\n\\n- It is a bit unclear to the reader what some of these parameters mean, for example: monetary expansion (rho) and treasury expansion (tau). Suggestion: Include brief explanations for the non-obvious parameters.\\n\\nThese are existing protocol parameters, described in e.g. [https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip9/](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/parameter-guide/#:~:text=Protocol%20parameters%20on%20Cardano%20are,to%20changing%20conditions%20over%20time.)9 or [The Cardano Protocol Parameters Guide](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/parameter-guide/#:~:text=Protocol%20parameters%20on%20Cardano%20are,to%20changing%20conditions%20over%20time.).\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n- With the current set of governance actions, it seems that it is not possible to add new types of protocol parameters, or categories of governance voting thresholds. Suggestion: Consider possibility of incorporating governance actions that allow addition of new protocol parameters, deletion of defunct protocol parameters, or modification of governance voting threshold categories. \\n\\nAll of this needs to be done via a hard fork. If we had an action that added a parameter then there is no way of giving it semantics anyway, since that must be done by logic in the code.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Votes\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Is a constitutional committee member also a DRep? If so, do they vote twice, once as a committee member and once as a DRep?\\n\\nThey may or may not be (and they could also be an SPO). Note that this is fine, since these are completely separate tallies. This is also not preventable, since we don\u2019t have an on-chain mechanism for identity. And yes, each credential gets to vote on each action for all roles in the governance system it has.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n### Section: Separation of Hard Fork Initiation from Standard Protocol Parameter Changes\\n\\n---\\n\\n- It is unclear whether there would be automated checks for whether a proposal is indeed a soft fork or hard fork, which would reduce human error in categorising proposals.\\n\\nThere is no on-chain mechanism that could enforce this, the best we could do is some kind of certificate.  However, this may not be trustworthy, of course. We will consider this in future versions of Voltaire.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Changes post Edinburgh workshop (July 2023)\\n\\n---\\n\\n- \u201cAll governance actions are enacted one epoch after they are ratified.\u201d - I\u2019m not sure if this line is currently in the main body of the CIP?\\n\\nIt is, but it is phrased differently: \u2018All governance actions are enacted on the epoch boundary after their ratification.\u2019\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Section: Reduced deposits for some government actions\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Another downside of requiring endorsement from the constitutional committee is that this likely does not apply to constitutional committee-related proposals, such as no-confidence votes.\\n\\nIndeed. We have no plans for this at the moment."},{"id":"2023-11-17-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-11-17-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-11-17-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-17-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High-level summary","date":"2023-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 17, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":1.135,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Hydra Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2023-11-17-hydra","authors":["ch1bo"],"tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Initial CIP 1694 Security Analysis and Responses","permalink":"/2023-11-20-cip1694"},"nextItem":{"title":"Performance & Tracing Update","permalink":"/2023-11-17-performance-and-tracing"}},"content":"## High-level summary\\n\\nThis week, the Hydra team made several impactful updates.

A lot of development work has entered the system since then, so it is crucial\\nwe can rule out any potential performance risks for the next mainnet release.   \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve been benchmarking GHC9.6.3 builds of `cardano-node`. Overall, we\'ve observed reliable optimization behaviour by that compiler version - which is much more in line with expectations than what we\'ve seen on GHC9.2.7. Getting evidence on how predictable (and malleable, by code annotations) performance is when building with a certain compiler version is essential for settling on a version as supported release platform. \\n\\nA last set of benchmarks was dedicated to the new tracing system with node `8.6.0`. We were able to show that\\nthere is no performance risk to enabling the new system, even when forwarding all trace messages to a `cardano-tracer`\\nservice on the receiving end. Key metrics for block forging, as well as block diffusion, did not exhibit any regression.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nFor future benchmarks to be built around PlutusV3, we\'ve equipped our transaction generator with basic integration and tests for the upcoming Plutus version. This enables us to target the new cost model and potential changes\\nto the execution budgets by developing specialized workloads.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe `cardano-tracer` service has received its first batch of optimizations. Profiling output is promising; to measure\\nperformance for a long service run time, we\'re currently equipping the service binary with the same capability to\\nemit regular resource traces as `cardano-node`. Analysis of those will be the basis for validating this and possible future optimization efforts.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nMany improvements for the nomad backend have been implemented and merged to `master`. This encompasses a unified naming schema for all nomad profiles, improved internal management of cluster topology, a more fine-grained healthcheck service,\\nmore detailed automated documentation of underlying hardware, as well as lazy resource release.

This ranges from capturing package versions and commit ids of key dependencies, to querying a deployed node for its build compiler.\\nWhen alternating between compiler versions and benchmarking custom built branches, automating such documentation is essential.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the workbench is now able to access several remote deployments on all active clusters.

to quality of Conway era implementation and\\ntooling that we use for testing Ledger. Major Conway bugs that were discovered and\\nsquashed are:\\n\\n* PParamsUpdate proposals will now correctly use DRep thresholds for ratification\\n* Treasury withdrawals are now properly enacted.\\n* Corrected snapshotting and DRep Stake Distribution Pulser initialization\\n* Delegation to non-existent Stake pool is no longer possible\\n\\nOther important quality of life improvements are addition of reusable interfaces for an\\nordered set `OSet` and ordered map `OMap`. Which allowed us to disable duplicate\\ncertificates and proposals in a transaction. As a precursor to `PlutusV3` integration, a\\nserious reorganization of Plutus related functionality was performed.\\n\\nConway related additions that are noteworthy: Conway Ledger events, disallowing voting on\\nexpired proposals, addition of Anchor to Constitutional Committee resignation proposals.\\n\\nSignificant improvements have been made to a specialized \\"Imp\\" test library that allows us\\nwriting concise stateful unit tests for verifying the Ledger logic. Serious progress has\\nbeen made on the conformance testing, where we can now interface with Haskell generated\\ncode from the Agda specification. Serialization testing has been extended to increase\\nbinary conformance coverage.\\n\\n\\n## Low level summary\\n\\n### Conway\\n\\n* [pull-3808] - Enhance `CommitteeMembersState` query to return quorum and NoConfidence\\n* [pull-3801] -

While we wait on this, we are evaluating the feasibility of making the UTxO-HD feature switchable, which will enable us to release it as an experimental feature. On the Genesis front we produced the first draft for a Survivable Eclipse Duration Model. We released version 8.5.0 of Cardano node, resumed work on subpar handling of blocks from the future, and improved our tracing system to assist problem troubleshooting in the node.\\n\\n### UTxO-HD\\n\\n- The Plutus workload benchmark for the in-memory backend [showed no regressions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/issues/203#issuecomment-1768560330) for the metrics of interest, but it does show an increase in resource usage.\\n- We got additional ad-hoc [measurements](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/5495#issuecomment-1768593069) on memory UTxO-HD consumption. The memory usage of the in-memory backend is not satisfactory for a release. The memory usage of the LMDB backend is considerably lower, but we need to see how much lower we can bring it by running a node whose memory is constrained to 8GB.\\n- We resumed work on an alternative solution that will make the UTxO-HD switchable. This will enable us to keep the baseline performance by totally disabling UTxO-HD, while allowing users to experiment with the feature if they wish to do so.\\n\\n### Genesis\\n\\n- We produced the first draft for a Survivable Eclipse Duration Model ([422](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/pull/422)).\\n\\n### Support\\n\\n- [Esgen](https://github.com/amesgen) finished his cycle as release engineer.

Optimization of `cardano-tracer` started.\\n* Nomad backend: Ongoing variance analysis and refined cluster topology.\\n\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nPerforming and analyzing benchmarks for the UTxO-HD feature is an ongoing effort; we can reliably assess the\\nperformance of the in-memory backing store and evaluate possible optimizations (or regressions) for it.  \\n\\nFurthermore, benchmarks of our new tracing system after several rounds of optimization have been performed. The results\\nshow all key metrics now being unaffected by the choice of tracing system (legacy or new) - with the new system being able to provide more features and flexibility in comparison. The benchmarks also highlighted further points for optimization, with the focus now on the `cardano-tracer` service.\\n\\n### Consensus QTAs\\n\\nThe Quantitative Timeliness Agreements (QTA) prototype is being used in coordination with Consensus and DevX to validate a series of patches that address optmization opportunities which GHC8.10 seizes, but GHC9.2 misses. The\\nfeedback from this approach is much more immediate than running benchmarks at system integration level. But once we eventually do, we expect to reproduce the relevant observations - which would mean a big step towards maturing the prototype.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nBenchmarking UTxO-HD\'s on-disk backing store needs special attention: in virtualized environments, disk I/O is not a reliable metric as it passes several layers of indirection. As this is the very metric which will influence overall performance of this UTxO-HD flavour, we developed a plan to monitor such nodes, connected to a running network, on dedicated hardware - having direct SSD access. Replicating this setup for an entire benchmarking cluster of such nodes will be a future effort.  \\n\\nPlutusV3 will come with new builtins and a new cost model. It will take a specialized benchmark to ascertain the soundness of that model running a full cluster of nodes, possibly stressing expensive builtins. At the same time,\\nwe\'d like to validate the many improvements that have gone into the Plutus evaluator.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe focus for further optimization of the new tracing system has shifted to `cardano-tracer` - the service\\nreceiving and processing traces from one (or more) nodes. Whilst undisputed that the code living in `cardano-node` is\\nmore performance critical, the receiving service must still minimize its resource footprint. Moreover, it can\\ngenerate load for a running node when querying data points from it - which calls for tight control of that mechanism and its possible configurations.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nVariance analysis of new nomad backend has revealed a necessary adjustment of the cluster\'s topology. We repeated\\nthe same analysis and now see even better confidence in the measurements taken with nomad. This concludes the work on the backend proper for the time being. The last steps before production use will focus on the interface between backend and our workbench, which provides all high-level benchmark definitions and analysis machinery."},{"id":"2023-10-04-consensus","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-10-04-consensus","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-10-04-consensus.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-04-consensus.md","title":"Consensus Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 4, 2023","tags":[{"label":"consensus","permalink":"/tags/consensus"}],"readingTime":1.135,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Nadales","title":"Consensus Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/dnadales","imageURL":"https://github.com/dnadales.png","key":"dnadales"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","slug":"2023-10-04-consensus","authors":"dnadales","tags":["consensus"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-10-06-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mithril Team Update","permalink":"/2023-10-04-mithril"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThe value-only workload benchmarks showed that the mempool forging regression observed in the UTxO-HD branch was fixed by the latest patch.

Currently, we see that\\n`typed-protocols-0.2.0.0` can outperform `typed-protocols-0.1.0.0` when running\\nin isolation with a simple `ping-pong` protocol, so the regression might be in\\nthe new block fetch implementation which comes with `typed-protocols-0.2.0.0`\\nSee [typed-protocols#3].\\n\\n### Tech Debt\\n\\nWe merged two PRs written by Galois engineers:\\n\\n* a pull request which refactors the main entry function for P2P, see [ouroboros-network#3834]; \\n* a pull request which reviews usage of `unsafe` function in the network code based.\\n\\nGalois also made progress with the following two issues:\\n * add microbenchmarks to some of our tests: [ouroboros-network#3832]\\n * inspect use of `error` in `ouroboros-network` repository:\\n   [ouroboros-network#3836]\\n\\n### IO-Sim\\n\\n#### IOSimPOR\\nWe found and fixed a bug in `IOSimPOR`.

We found out that it gives\\nonly 25% better performance.  In the future QuickCheck will offer running\\ndifferent cases in parallel which should provide better performance as there\\nare no dependencies between the evaluation of different test cases, while schedules\\nare discovered while running which limits the possible gains from running them\\nconcurrently.  The performance was not the only factor though.  When using\\nparallelism in the lazy `ST` monad we\'d need to rely on memory guarantees of\\n`STRefs`.

low-level network and high-level variance analysis of our benchmarking clusters.\\n* Infrastructure: Our reporting pipeline was adjusted to classify various workloads easily reducing rework time.\\n* Tracing: Work on machine-readable tracing of tracer configuration is ongoing.\\n* Nomad backend: We\'ve been able to eliminate several possible confounders on the nomad cluster.\\n* Team: We\'re currently onboarding a new team member: Welcome to Cardano Performance & Tracing, Baldur Bl\xf6ndal!\\n\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nAs part of the effort to bring the Nomad backend into production use, we\'ve been equipping both that and the existing benchmarking\\nbackend with means to measure and document network latency for each run. Furthermore we\'ve implemented means to\\ncapture TCP packets for a limited time window during a benchmarking run - which will allow us to spot differences\\nin the behaviour of the underlying networking stack at OS level.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'re running variance analysis in parallel on both backends to ascertain confidence in metrics originating from either. We\'ve concluded that baseline profile runs aren\'t directly comparable between the two, so we decided\\nto compare standard deviations instead to validate the measurements from nomad.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nReporting on benchmarks does require human time and effort to rework the final document. Improvements to the reporting pipeline\\nhave been merged to `master`. They reduce the time necessary to do so by various changes to the template and the workload classification logic in analysis.  \\n\\nBeyond that, we\'ve looked into issues where services would quit with an unjustified exit failure upon shutdown - under rare circumstances. By reworking shutdown logic for `trace-dispatcher` and `tx-generator` we were able to address those issues.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nAfter various steps in constructing a configuration upon node startup, it is vital to document\\nwhich runtime configuration the node arrived eventually. We\'re working on providing a machine-readable JSON/YAML\\ntrace message for that purpose.  \\n\\nThis will facilitate hot-reloading a node\'s tracer configuration in the future: users will be able to take such a trace message, apply their intended change and hot-reload it immediately into the node. \\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nAs with the existing benchmarking cluster, nomad is currently under scrutiny with regard to the reliability of metrics it\\nproduces, as well as the behaviour of its OS-level network stack. For instance, differing kernel versions can have an\\nimpact on our measurements, as we\'d be basically using two different instruments to take them.  \\n\\nAlong the way we\'ve already been successful in eliminating some possible confounders that had been introduced by the nomad service\\nor the slightly different system architecture of the new cluster.\\n\\n### New team member\\n\\nBaldur Bl\xf6ndal is an extremely capable and experienced Haskell developer. Also, he\'s an excellent fit for our existing team.\\nSo I\'m very pleased to welcome him onboard with IOG, and with Performance & Tracing. He will be working on `cardano-tracer`, the component receiving, processing and making available node traces and metrics."},{"id":"2023-09-20-consensus","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-09-20-consensus","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-09-20-consensus.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-20-consensus.md","title":"Consensus Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"consensus","permalink":"/tags/consensus"}],"readingTime":1.82,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Nadales","title":"Consensus Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/dnadales","imageURL":"https://github.com/dnadales.png","key":"dnadales"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","slug":"2023-09-20-consensus","authors":"dnadales","tags":["consensus"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-09-22-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mithril Team Update","permalink":"/2023-09-20-mithril"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nWe have a proposed fix for the mempool forging regression observed in the UTxO-HD branch.

There are some loose ends to wrap up before we can begin the first test run.\\n- We also brought the `UTxO-HD` branch up to date with node version `8.4.0`.\\n\\n### Genesis\\n\\n- We finished the discussion with the Researchers on how to argue that the proposed Genesis design is satisfactory for the existing historical Cardano chain.\\n  We are now drafting the final self-contained argument.

For runs that exceed their expected duration, analysis now supports a truncation\\noperation that keeps the interdependencies of block events intact.  \\n\\nTruncation might happen at a slightly different point\\nin time - and therefore in its log object stream - for each node in the cluster. An additional step validating the block hash timeline of the cluster has been implemented for the pipeline. It provides early feedback on whether a specific truncation will lead to a valid full analysis, which requires much more time.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nConsistency checking of namespace implementation and configuration when using the new system has been completed.\\nThis feature enables feedback on when tracer implementation details in some component might have changed. It\'s also able to detect when a configuration used for operating a `cardano-node` shows inconsistencies with the namespaces the system provides - and hence needs attention.  \\n \\nFurthermore, we\'ve created a fine-grained configuration of the new system that caters to benchmarking\'s need of very many\\ndetailed trace messages. It\'s aimed at mirroring the same amount of trace messages, and information, we\'re seeing from our usage of the legacy system; an important step in making benchmarks between systems comparable.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nThe new backend is currently being used for further validation with regard to the existing cluster. Additionally, we\'re using it in production mode to comparatively benchmark both tracing systems after merging past month\'s optimizations - which is the\\nfirst real-life application of the nomad cluster. Hands-on experience in that phase translates into many small improvements which can be immediately applied to enhance user experience for the new backend."},{"id":"2023-09-06-consensus","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-09-06-consensus","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-09-06-consensus.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-06-consensus.md","title":"Consensus Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 6, 2023","tags":[{"label":"consensus","permalink":"/tags/consensus"}],"readingTime":2.22,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Nadales","title":"Consensus Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/dnadales","imageURL":"https://github.com/dnadales.png","key":"dnadales"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","slug":"2023-09-06-consensus","authors":"dnadales","tags":["consensus"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-09-07-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","permalink":"/2023-09-01-goedel"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nWe were able to successfully run the system-level benchmarks for the UTxO-HD implementation, for the first time. There was an important regression in block forging performance that will have to be addressed before UTxO-HD is released. We also revisited the implementation of our query processing logic, which was needed to address the performance regression found in the query-by-address command. The preliminary performance results show that now the performance of this query is on-par with the Cardano baseline version, but we need further confirmation.\\nOn the Genesis front, we presented the grinding-aware safety argument for the proposed historical Cardano Genesis windows to the IOG Researchers.\\nThe Consensus release engineer finished his rotation: version `8.3.0-pre` of `cardano-node` is releasing 2023 September 5.\\n\\n## UTxO-HD\\n\\n- We ran the first successful system-level benchmarks for UTxO-HD (see [#203](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/issues/203)) using the *in-memory* backend.\\n    - We observed a factor 12 regression in the forging performance, which we will have to address. There are strong indications that the regression is due to the backing store accesses that take place when taking a mempool snapshot.\\n    - After the mempool regression is fixed the benchmarks need to be ran again.\\n    - System-level UTxO-HD benchmarks with the LMDB are still pending.\\n- UTxO-HD will eventually be necessary due to the growth of the UTxO set and other ledger state structures that live in memory at the moment. However, we are trying a strategy by which we could preserve the baseline performance of the node, in case SPOs and other node users are not ready to migrate yet (see [#344](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/issues/344)).\\n- We implemented a new way of processing queries at the hard-fork block level, which resolves the performance regression observed in `GetUTxOByAddress` (see [this comment](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/issues/205#issuecomment-1706878418)). Preliminary results are promising.\\n- Regarding the roll out plan, UTxO-HD requires a significant change in the Consensus codebase. Even though we might be able to hide any potential performance impact in the node by keeping all data in memory ([#344](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/issues/344)), the Consensus component was significantly changed, so we might have to postpone releasing this feature to mitigate any risks of conflicting with the implementation of CIP-1694 and release of Conway.\\n\\n## Tech debt\\n\\n- We added tests that Consensus emits valid CBOR ([#3099](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3099)). This helped us detect a couple of serialization bugs. The tests still need to be merged into the `main` branch ([#323](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/pull/323)).\\n\\n## Support\\n\\n- [Nick Frisby](https://github.com/nfrisby) finished his release engineer rotation; `cardano-node 8.3.0-pre` is releasing 2023 September 5.\\n- We helped to investigate a protocol version bug in Sanchonet (see [#3491](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/3491)).\\n- We started to implement the Network interface for bootstrap peer functionality, from which Genesis will benefit as well (see [#91](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/issues/91)."},{"id":"2023-09-01-goedel","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-09-01-goedel","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-09-01-goedel.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-01-goedel.md","title":"Goedel Team Update","description":"The team works on applied research and consulting in formal methods","date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"goedel","permalink":"/tags/goedel"}],"readingTime":0.43,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"James Chapman","title":"Head of Formal Methods","url":"https://github.com/jmchapman","imageURL":"https://github.com/jmchapman.png","key":"jmchapman"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","slug":"2023-09-01-goedel","authors":"jmchapman","tags":["goedel"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2023-09-06-consensus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2023-09-01-hydra"}},"content":"The team works on applied research and consulting in formal methods\\nthat is directly applicable to evidence based engineering in Core Tech\\nand beyond.\\n\\n## High level summary\\n\\nThe team is currently formalising mini protocols and also further\\ndeveloping the performance modelling prototype.\\n\\n## Details\\n\\n* finalising a presenting performance analysis internship work to the\\n  formal methods team\\n\\n* developed a new Isabelle mini-protocol framework and examples\\n\\n* planning an extended version of the ICE DeltaQ paper\\n\\n* working on algebraic rules for properisation of any-to-finish"},{"id":"2023-09-01-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-09-01-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-09-01-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-01-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High-level summary","date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":0.93,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sasha Bogicevic","title":"Hydra Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/v0d1ch","imageURL":"https://github.com/v0d1ch.png","key":"v0d1ch"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2023-09-01-hydra","authors":["v0d1ch"],"tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","permalink":"/2023-09-01-goedel"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2023-09-01-ledger"}},"content":"## High-level summary\\n\\nThis week, the Hydra team focused primarily on changes needed in the network\\nlayer and have the first draft document related to needed design.

These timeouts help a node remove idle connections from the\\n  responder (server) side [ouroboros-network-#4648].\\n* he improved the `WireShark` dissector by adding support for the `peer-sharing` mini-protocol [ouroboros-network-#4656].\\n\\n[Galois] has been making progress in addressing some of the issues they raised in their review (last year):\\n* Mark Tullsen ([Galois]) has been working on refactoring the main entry function of P2P [ouroboros-network-#4661] (in review);\\n* Sam Cowger ([Galois]) has been reviewing all use cases of `error` and `unsafe` calls\\n  [ouroboros-network-#4661] (in review).\\n\\n## Peer Sharing\\n\\n* Light peer sharing is only enabled when peer sharing is turned on [ouroboros-network-#4652];\\n* Handshake incorrectly reports peer sharing value.  It\'s supposed to relay the\\n  remote value, but instead, it returns the local value. [ouroboros-network-#4642] (in review).\\n\\n## Async Demotion Test Fix\\n\\n* We fixed an async demotion test failure which turned out to be a weakness of\\n  the test itself rather than a bug in the connection manager.

Changes to the in-memory data representation improving on compactness were able to reduce the RAM requirements of our analysis pipeline.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe next portion of optimizations has been completed and merged to `master`, getting rid of Haskell\'s native `String` representation on critical code paths.

We\\nalso prepared a PR to updated [`ouroboros-cosnensus`][ouroboros-consensus#165]\\nand [`ekg-forward`][ekg-forward#30] packages.\\n\\n### CDDL specs for protocol codecs\\n\\nWe made the `cddl` spec for network codec more inline with the implementation\\nwhich is highly polymorphic.  `cddl` doesn\'t have the notion of polymorphism,\\nbut has `any` which can generate any valid cbor term.  We matched it with an\\n`Any` type on the Haskell side and made all remaining tests & specs use it.\\nThis simplified the specifications and made it easier to understand which parts\\nare defined in the spec, and which parts are left unspecified.  See\\n[ouroboros-network#4595].\\n\\n### Ouroboros-Network-Framework API changes\\n\\nWe also released `ouroboros-network-framework` and other network components.\\nThe `ouroboros-network-framework` package contains a redesign of API exposed to\\n`ouroboros-consensus`.  We consolidated, cleaned it and made it easier to\\nextend in the future if there will be new arguments that need to be passed to\\nmini-protocol initiator and responders which comes from the low-level network\\nlayer.\\n\\n### Nix setup (CI)\\n\\nWe also made a major review of our `nix` setup.  With help from our DevX team\\nwe ended up with a clean `flake.nix` file which can:\\n\\n* compile & test the code on `x86_64-linux`, `x86_64-darwin` and `aarch64-darwin`\\n* cross-compile to `Windows` on `x86_64-linux` \\n\\nAnd provides a shell which contains all the build tools, including `ghc-9.6`,\\n`hls`, `cddl`, and more.

It was (accidentally) triggered on the Cardano Testnet before a fix could be deployed there.\\n\\n#### What Action was Taken\\nThe Cardano Testnet was permanently halted, and new test environments were deployed (Preview and Pre-Prod).\\nFixes were applied to prevent the use of the primitives.\\nA full security audit was carried out on the bindings.\\nThe rollout of the primitives was postponed to a new hard fork (Valentine)\\n\\n#### Potential Effect\\nThe potential effect was that an adversary might be able to craft invalid Plutus transactions to crash any node, requiring execution of the Cardano disaster recovery plan to revert to a safe state and bypass the transaction.\\n\\n#### Actual Effect\\n* Delay to the Vasil hard-fork\\n* Temporary removal of SECP256k1 primitives\\n* Additional hard-fork to introduce SECP256k1 primitives\\n\\n#### Ongoing Mitigations Needed, if any\\nNone\\n\\n#### Responsibility for Mitigations\\nCore team\\n\\n### Detailed description of Incident\\nNew Plutus **secp256k1** cryptographic primitives for Plutus v2 failed to apply the necessary validity checks on the input data, meaning that the primitives could theoretically be used in an unsafe environment.  The vulnerability was present in recent node versions (1.35.0 onwards), including ones deployed to Cardano Testnet.\\n\\nThe problem was not in the deserialization functions of the underlying library (Bitcoin\'s library) but rather that the Haskell functions that implemented the Plutus builtins were not calling them correctly.  In particular, the library functions were designed to take structured data as input. However, the Haskell FFI implementation that was produced for the Plutus builtins allowed a caller to pass in (possibly) unstructured data. There were no checks that these data were structured in the correct way.  This issue was detected during End-to-End testing.\\n\\n* [This](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/include/secp256k1.h#L518) is the ECDSA signature verification algorithm that was used. It takes a SECP256k1_pubkey as input. That type is an opaque type with an [expected](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/include/secp256k1.h#L61) structure: a parsed and valid public key.  It was not immediately obvious that structured data needed to be passed to allow the function to be used safely.\\n* The same happened with the Schnorr [verification function](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/include/secp256k1_schnorrsig.h#L170). It takes as input a SECP256k1_xonly_pubkey, which is again an [opaque structure](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/include/secp256k1_extrakeys.h#L10) that holds a parsed and valid public key.\\n\\nThe FFI skipped checks over these structured keys and directly passed the raw bytes that were given as arguments. If an adversary were to pass in data that was not properly structured, then it could result in unexpected behavior of the library. This could perhaps translate into an adversary being able to crash the nodes that ran these functions.  All nodes in the network could be crashed by a single transaction that would then be executed repeatedly, so stalling the network until the disaster recovery process was initiated.\\n\\nThe fix was addressed in [this](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/289) PR. It consisted of using the external representation that the deserialization function expects and running the deserialization prior to signature verification.  This was audited by security experts.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n* Check all new Plutus bindings for correct use.\\n* Audit all new Plutus built-in bindings.\\n* Continue to develop specific End-to-End tests for all new Plutus features.\\n* Do not assume that any existing library functions are \\"safe\\". Treat all external calls circumspectly."},{"id":"2023-08-15-node-cli-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-08-15-node-cli-api","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-08-15-node-cli-api.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-15-node-cli-api.md","title":"Node

6th August 2023_\\n\\nWe started the implementation of __bootstrap peers__.  Bootstrap peers are designed\\nto provide a safety guarantee for nodes joining the network while still taking\\nadvantage of the distributed network for nodes that are synced.  This will be\\nan intermediate step before Genesis which will allow for further distribute the\\nsystem.  The bootstrap peers will be run by some trusted partners like CF,\\nEmurgo or IOG.   They are primarily designed for leaf nodes (e.g. full node\\nwallets), which often end up syncing and require access to the honest chain. See\\n[ouroboros-network#4615] for a more detailed implementation plan.\\n\\n## Other contributions\\n\\nWe started to use `nothunks` library to discover if we have any unevaluated\\nthunks which can lead to memory leaks [ouroboros-network#4633].  We found\\na small one in the peer metric component of the P2P networking stack.  Fixing\\nit put us on a small detour of fixing the API of the [`strict-checked-vars`]\\npackage: [cardano-base#431], [cardano-base#432], as well as adding `NFData`\\ninstance to [`io-classes`][io-classes#110].  We also improved `nothunks`\\nlibrary to make debugging easier and we provided a `NoThunks` instance for\\n`ThreadId` which we will need in the future (see [nothunks#33]).\\n\\nWe released a new version of `io-classes` (version `1.2.0.0`) and related\\npackages to [Hackage][io-classes-1.2.0.0].\\n\\nWe addressed all review comments on the eclipse evasion PR which introduces big\\nledger peers, [ouroboros-network#3886].\\n\\nWe fixed how `SIGHUP` signal handlers are registered, so it\'s not possible to\\nshutdown a node which was starting while trying to update network topology,\\nsee [cardano-node#5421].\\n\\nI didn\'t mention that in the previous update, so here it goes: in the previous\\nsprint we released [`ouroboros-network-0.8.2.0`] and\\n[`ouroboros-network-framework-0.7.0.0`].\\n\\n[sprint-41]: https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/19/views/16?filterQuery=sprint%3A%22sprint+41%22\\n\\n[`strict-checked-vars`]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/tree/master/strict-checked-vars\\n[cardano-base#431]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pulls/431\\n[cardano-base#432]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pulls/432\\n[cardano-node#5421]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/5421\\n[ouroboros-network#3886]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3886\\n[ouroboros-network#4615]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4615\\n[ouroboros-network#4633]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4633\\n[`ouroboros-network-0.8.2.0`]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/blob/f84fcddce472d6cfc2b838b20a2ad085fe0896ed/ouroboros-network/CHANGELOG.md\\n[`ouroboros-network-framework-0.7.0.0`]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/blob/ouroboros-network-framework-0.7.0.0/ouroboros-network-framework/CHANGELOG.md\\n[io-classes#110]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/110\\n[io-classes-1.2.0.0]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-classes-1.2.0.0io-classes-1.2.0.0\\n[nothunks#33]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/nothunks/pull/33"},{"id":"2023-08-04-performance-and-tracing","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-08-04-performance-and-tracing","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-08-04-performance-and-tracing.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-04-performance-and-tracing.md","title":"Performance & tracing update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 4, 2023","tags":[{"label":"performance-tracing","permalink":"/tags/performance-tracing"}],"readingTime":1.76,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Karg","title":"Performance and Tracing Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/mgmeier","imageURL":"https://github.com/mgmeier.png","key":"mgmeier"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","slug":"2023-08-04-performance-and-tracing","authors":"mgmeier","tags":["performance-tracing"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Network Team Update","permalink":"/2023-08-04-network"},"nextItem":{"title":"SRE Team Update","permalink":"/2023-08-04-sre"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\n* Benchmarking: We\'re adjusting the benchmarking cluster to handle runs for node version `8.2.0`.\\n* Tracing: We\'ve finished optimization of the new tracing system and added extra robustness with regard to namespacing.\\n* Infrastructure: We\'ve been working on making all benchmarking code compliant with the latest GHC9.6.\\n* Nomad backend: The new backend has seen adjustments due to a change of underlying hardware.

Additionally, a roadmap for implementing Consensus QTAs has been developed.\\n* Infrastructure: Our workbench has undergone some refactoring to seamlessly integrate its profiles into all available backends.\\n* Tracing: Optimization of the new tracing system is ongoing and yielding good performance results.\\n* Nomad backend: We developed a new feature for the nomad backend which allows pinning deployments to specific machines.\\n\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nOur analysis of the GHC9 build of `cardano-node` has produced several locations in the code base where the new compiler seems to miss opportunities for optimization. Our hypothesis is, that those can account for the difference in resource usage we observe when benchmarking with a full cluster run. Instructing the compiler on how to perform the optimizations which GHC8 apparently applied out of the box requires further investigation.  \\n  \\nIn an effort to define Quantitative Timeliness Agreements (QTAs) on a per-component basis, we have coordinated with the Consensus team and developed a roadmap for providing those on consensus level. Making use of the insight that system-level benchmarks allow, we intend to set up and calibrate a benchmark that can reliably predict a regression or optimization for select metrics before needing full integration into `cardano-node`. This will help tremendously in various ways: catching regressions much earlier, localizing them much easier, avoiding repeated component integration and much shorter feedback cycle.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nWe have worked on seamless integration of our benchmarking profiles into the many available backends that the workbench provides. The goal was to be backend-agnostic, to guarantee that all benchmarking run artifacts be structurally identical as far as their file name, format and location are concerned. This lead to refactoring work and has already landed in `master`.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nMuch effort went into further optimization of the new tracing system. After working on configuration to align both new and legacy tracing system with regard to their trace frequencies, we could uncover some increase in resource usage. This occurred for corner cases under very heavy load. These cases have been addressed already, and do now surpass the legacy tracing system in terms of performance.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nFor reliable benchmarking results it is vital to introduce as few confounding factors as possible when performing runs. This includes hardware and network topology. The nomad backend has been outfitted with a mechanism to pin the nomad job for some node in our benhcmarking cluster to a specific machine instance. This greatly increases confidence in the metrics observed from a run.  \\n\\nFurthermore this feature will detect any change in the underlying hardware or topology so it can be taken into account.

This is really only useful for downstream packages that use the parts of consensus that don\'t involve the storage components, in which case we can largely ignore ledger tables. Ignoring ledger tables could also make functionality like block (re-)application more performant for the legacy Cardano block as compared to the actual (UTxO-HD compatible) Cardano block.\\n- We performed ad-hoc benchmarks of the UTxO-HD implementation, observing a regression in sync speed in the LMDB implementation as well as a regression in memory usage on the in-memory implementation.

We\'re currently locating the specific places in component code that have the most extensive effect in that regard.  \\n  \\nUsing the `forge-stress` approximation we set up, we could determine that above effect is not due to a range of RTS parameters, as for example the number of capabilites used by the node.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe `tx-generator` is a crucial part of our tooling responsible for producing very specific workloads for our benchmarking cluster. In an effort to flesh out an API to make it reusable for more general use cases, a first set of refactorings has been merged to `master`. Additionally, this merge contained systematic documentation both for internal and for exposed areas of the code base.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe tracing system\'s concurrency could under certain conditions prevent a graceful shutdown of the node. This issue did occur only after adding specific new traces on a development branch. We could localize and address that issue.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nWith the data gathered from running the new nomad cloud backend, we\'ve been able to address many, many small and medium-sized improvements. The deployment process has been restructured for better efficiency, and the healthcheck system could be fine-tuned to recognize severity of various conditions that might occur. Optimization of fetching all run data from the cloud for evaluation is in progress.\\n\\nAdditionally, we\'re continuing the new backend\'s validation by setting up test runs and looking into comparative analyses with metrics gathered from the current cluster backend."},{"id":"2023-06-23-goedel","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-06-23-goedel","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-06-23-goedel.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-23-goedel.md","title":"Goedel Team Update","description":"The team works on applied research and consulting in formal methods","date":"2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 23, 2023","tags":[{"label":"goedel","permalink":"/tags/goedel"}],"readingTime":0.335,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"James Chapman","title":"Head of Formal Methods","url":"https://github.com/jmchapman","imageURL":"https://github.com/jmchapman.png","key":"jmchapman"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","slug":"2023-06-23-goedel","authors":"jmchapman","tags":["goedel"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-06-28-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2023-06-23-hydra"}},"content":"The team works on applied research and consulting in formal methods\\nthat is directly applicable to evidence based engineering in Core Tech\\nand beyond.\\n\\n## High level summary\\n\\nThis sprint the teams presented two papers at ICE 2023.\\n\\n## Details\\n\\n* Presented two papers at ICE 2023: https://www.discotec.org/2023/ice\\n\\n* Analysing and implementing chain synchronization mini protocol\\n\\n* The team is hiring a performance engineering intern -

So for metrics to be\\nmeaningful in a comparison, benchmarking profiles have to be tuned such that not only log line frequency but frequency of specific\\ntrace messages are closely aligned. We\'ve found that higher granularity in this regard was necessary, and done additional work on our dedicated profiles.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve had a first glance of what additional traces could be valuable in the context of benchmarking UTxO-HD.\\n\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\n\\nAs the new backend\'s healthcheck system in its first iteration can now serve as a guardrail to ensure sanity of a full-length run, we\'ve performed our first 52-node cluster runs on nomad cloud.

See [#140].\\n\\n#### New `cardano-ping` / `cardano-cli ping` release\\n\\nWe prepared a new release of `cardano-ping` library which supports the new\\nquery feature (query supported versions). See [#4589], [#4593] and [#5313].\\nThe new version of `cardano-cli ping` will use `ISO8601` formatted\\ntimestamps; also the formatting of ping results is slightly improved, and it\\nwill introduce the new `--query-versions` (`-Q`) switch.

Also `cardano-cli ping` will no longer announce\\nitself as `InitiatorAndResponder`, except for the case mentioned above.\\n\\n### Other smaller contributions\\n\\nOn a request from the Marlow Team, we published haddocks of `typed-protocols`,\\nwhich are now available [here][typed-protocols-haddocks] ([#40], [#41]).\\n\\nWe made a new release of `strict-stm-1.1.0.1` on Hackage, which fixed a bug in\\npackage description file, [#101] .\\n\\nWe also helped to debug a deadlock when using named pipes on Windows in the new\\n`RawBearer` API.

We\'ve discovered a significant difference in resource profile usage compared to GHC8.10. Further investigation uncovered the need for benchmarking another parameter change in the build\\nconfiguration: As it stands, the `ghc-bignum` package is using the Haskell `native-backend` as a default. We strive\\nto benchmark a build with the `gmp-backend` next.  \\n\\nA variant of our `forge-stress` local benchmark has been set up to serve as an early indicator for the resource usage profile\\nwe\'d expect to observe on the model cluster. This provides us with a much tighter feedback loop, as local run duration is way\\nshorter. This indicator is specific to changes in the configuration of build and the runtime systems, and will be of great\\nsupport when evaluating different compiler versions or RTS flags incrementally.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nThe hub of the new tracing system `cardano-tracer` is designed with a fixed output behaviour, which is limited to various\\nlogging options. Thanks to the contribution from Galois, that design is now extended to be able to re-forward all, or a pre-filtered portion, of traces from the node in a configurable manner. This will enable downstream applications to \\ndirectly receive the set of trace values relevant to their logic, without any additional cost for the node itself at all.\\n\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\nWe\'re currently working out the details of efficiently deploying and monitoring a fleet of 50+ nodes, along with\\njob definitions for tracing and transaction generation. Scaling up to those many instances, and monitoring an ongoing\\nbenchmarking run required us to fine-tune communications with the nomad server.  \\n\\nRelated to that, the new cloud backend will provide a monitoring and health-checking mechanism which is far more flexible\\nand offers more detailed insight than the previous iteration in `cardano-ops`. The backend will enable you to formulate\\nvery specific conditions for an ongoing run to be considered healthy, and offer automation of certain actions should these conditions not be met."},{"id":"2023-05-26-goedel","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-05-26-goedel","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-05-26-goedel.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-26-goedel.md","title":"Goedel Team Update","description":"The team works on applied research and consulting in formal methods","date":"2023-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"goedel","permalink":"/tags/goedel"}],"readingTime":0.39,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"James Chapman","title":"Head of Formal Methods","url":"https://github.com/jmchapman","imageURL":"https://github.com/jmchapman.png","key":"jmchapman"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","slug":"2023-05-26-goedel","authors":"jmchapman","tags":["goedel"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-05-31-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","permalink":"/2023-05-26-hydra"}},"content":"The team works on applied research and consulting in formal methods\\nthat is directly applicable to evidence based engineering in Core Tech\\nand beyond.\\n\\n## High level summary\\n\\nThis sprint the team has been working on final revisions for the\\npre-proceedings versions of two ICE 2023 papers.\\n\\n## Details\\n\\n* Porting Ouroboros Praos formalisation to new application layer.\\n\\n* Preparing pre-proceedings version of two ICE 2023 papers.\\n\\n* The team is hiring a performance engineering intern - https://apply.workable.com/io-global/j/BFEC5B0AFF/"},{"id":"2023-05-26-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-05-26-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-05-26-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-26-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High-level summary","date":"2023-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":1.11,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Hydra Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2023-05-26-hydra","authors":"ch1bo","tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","permalink":"/2023-05-26-goedel"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2023-05-26-ledger"}},"content":"## High-level summary\\n\\nThis week, the Hydra team accomplished several important tasks.

Currently, we\'re busy with the handover.\\n\\n## Low level overview\\n\\n### Benchmarking\\n\\nAs a compiler switch to GHC 9.2.7 for `cardano-node`\'s default build environment is around the corner, we\'re setting up our benchmarking cluster to\\nhandle the new version. Special attention is given to the fact that we might need more flexibility in switching compiler versions in the future. This\\nalso involves choosing a reliable baseline as reference point for inter-version comparisons.  \\n\\nAdditionally we\'ve been working on refining our model cluster: by increasing UTxO and delegation map sizes to closer match those of current mainnet,\\nwe strive to have a more accurate model - and thus be able to make more detailed predictions regarding performance. However, this still needs to\\nbe balanced against resource demand for all our cluster\'s nodes.\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nFor our new tracing system, we\'re currently validating the behaviour of the system after optimizations have been applied. Furthermore, some\\nquality-of-life details that have changed required us to revision the system documentation.\\n\\n### Analysis\\n\\nAs a mid-term goal, we aim to provide incremental analysis of our benchmarking metrics. While currently, we can only reliably process runs that have been\\nnormally (or abnormally) terminated, we see the possibility of incrementally analysing ongoing runs, or any data source yielding our key metrics, as a\\nhuge opportunity to increase our operational flexibility. All in all, this approach entails building completely new features for our pipeline. A first effort to accomodate incrementally incoming data points has been undertaken. \\n\\n### Open Sourcing\\n\\nA very involved and exhaustive documentation and visualization effort has been undertaken to make the data flow through our key benchmarking\\ncopmonents more accessible. As a result, detailed charts for both our LogObject CLI `locli` and our `workbench` have been merged to `master`. \\n\\n### Nomad backend\\nWhile our Nomad backend is reaching completion, and hardware setup is being implemented in collaboration with SRE, we\'ve been adjusting\\nthose profiles of our `workbench` that target CI-oriented workloads to the new backend. Those profiles should demonstrate the full functionality\\nof the nomad cloud backend.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'re porting a first deployable version of our model cluster to nomad cloud, which will form the basis for validation of our actual key metrics with regard to those from the existing cluster.\\n\\n### Performance & Tracing Meetup\\n\\nWe held a personal team meetup in Lugano, Switzerland. In an amazing location, and with a great seminar room to focus, we had 2 very productive\\ndays together. Being able to discuss live and in colour, we could effectively synchronize on where the team is at, and how we want to develop in the future.\\nAlso, it was a great opportunity to finally meet in person.\\n\\n### Offboarding\\n\\nLast not least we regret that our team lead is leaving at the end of May. Currently, he\'s handing over all his obligations, which requires reorganisation\\nof team structure, and responsabilities of team members for specific tasks. Serge, we all want to thank you for your excellent and reliable lead; we very much enjoyed the time with you, and wish you all the best for your future endeavours!"},{"id":"2023-05-12-crypto","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-05-12-crypto","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-05-12-crypto.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-12-crypto.md","title":"Crypto Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 12, 2023","tags":[{"label":"crypto","permalink":"/tags/crypto"}],"readingTime":1.095,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"I\xf1igo Querejeta Azurmendi","title":"Cardano Lead Cryptography Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iquerejeta","imageURL":"https://github.com/iquerejeta.png","key":"iquerejeta"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Crypto Team Update","slug":"2023-05-12-crypto","authors":"iquerejeta","tags":["crypto"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-05-17-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","permalink":"/2023-05-12-goedel"}},"content":"## High level summary\\nThe open fronts that the crypto team is working on are:\\n* cardano-base: Include final tests for BLS signature.

That way we were able to catch an inconsistency in behaviour early on. This led to the creation of a specialized workbench profile `epoch-transition` for local reproduction of what we observed on the benchmarking cluster.  \\n\\nFurthermore, we bridged the gap between the run data from the `1.35.x` releases to the the new `8.0.x` release branch. This included walking the\\n`master` branch backwards and pinpointing the order, as well as the dates and commits of all relevant component bumps.

This manifest will greatly increase insight into where changes in measured behaviour might have originated\\nby making all component bumps visible and accessible.\\n\\n### GHC profiling inside workbench\\nThe workbench has been equipped with a new `-profnix` profile flavour. This enforces a `-fprof-auto` build for all node-related packages. The type of\\nprofiling data generated by the GHC runtime can be customized and will enter statistical analysis. The relevant PR for this new feature has already\\nbeen merged to `master`.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\nThe added feature for a multi-client Nomad cluster greatly enhances how jobs are organized by the backend and mapped within specific instances.\\nThis results in great maintainability while not giving up on flexibility.

Around 50% of block-producing nodes and relays restarted during this period. Having restarted, nodes continued to produce blocks without failure. While the network continued to operate, the issue did have the potential to affect network integrity, so was flagged as a \u2018critical\u2019 incident, thus warranting immediate response and investigation by IOG engineers.\\nThe investigation (with SPO & Cardano Foundation collaboration) quickly revealed the cause of the issue \u2013 a complex bug in data structure handling code related to the precise order of insertion/deletion of multi-asset tokens into the internal ledger record. Input Output Global (IOG) engineers, along with SPOs and DApp developers, collectively identified how to reproduce the issue as a unit test that could be included in the standard Cardano node test suite.\\nFollowing successful testing, this led to a bug fix being implemented, tested, benchmarked, and deployed as a hotfix in the node v.1.35.5 release on Friday, January 27, 2023. Care was taken not to highlight the exact cause of the bug during this process so that it could not be exploited prior to SPOs deploying this new node version.\\nWith the fix deployed, the Cardano SPO and developer community have not seen any further instances of this issue.\\n\\n### Further Details\\n\\nYou can read more details on the incident and how it was managed from SundaeSwap\u2019s Pi Lanningham [here](https://www.314pool.com/post/cardano-post-mortem-1).

new `8.0` release branch and performed a (very) early run.\\n* New tracing: We\'re profiling the new tracing system for minimizing its resource footprint and guarantee high throughput.\\n* Analysis pipeline: Variance analysis both for reporting and for serving as a point of comparison has been merged.\\n* Infrastructure: A library for Plutus scripts will be integrated in our tooling and benchmarking profiles. Also, a profile family aimed at the tracing systems has been added.\\n* Nomad backend: Various specializations of the backend are currently being implemented, along with streamlining credentials management.\\n  \\n# Benchmarking\\n\\nWe have adapted our benchmarking cluster to the requirements of the `8.0` release branch. Testing runs of a very early feature branch for `8.0`\\nhelped us localize an important issue in collaboration with the other teams. We look forward to gathering preliminary metrics for `8.0` soon.\\n\\n# Tracing\\n\\nAnalysis of resource usage profiles of both the legacy and new tracing system, with and without trace forwarding, have lead us to gather very\\ndetailed profiling data for each possible setup. This is to ensure we keep resource usage within the node to an absolute minimum, while still providing\\nthe highest possible throughput of data for forwarding to `cardano-tracer`.   \\n\\nAdditionally, we\'ve worked on a very practically-oriented document targeted at end users of the new tracing system. It provides tested step-by-step instructions\\nfor tunneling trace forwarding from a node to `cardano-tracer` via an easy to manage system service, which will match the production setup of most users.\\n\\n# Infrastructure & Analysis\\n\\n### General\\nVariance analysis as a full-fledged entity in our tooling has been merged. Not only is this type of analysis now part of our reporting pipeline - variance\\nanalysis can be fed back and serve as an additional point of comparison.\\n\\nFurthermore, we\'ve created a profile family for the workbench that\'s specifically aimed at measuring and comparing tracing system configurations.\\n\\n### Plutus library\\nWe opened a PR containing a new package for benchmarking - an extendable library that holds all Plutus scripts we use in our benchmarking profiles.\\nThis will enable us in the future to iteratively work on customizing any given script, and the way is called in the context of a specific profile.\\nIt is a refinement of current affairs, where we have additional build inputs solely to generate a static script file tied to an external commit.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\nThe nomad backend is being specialized in three ways: using a podman driver locally, using nomad agents supporting nix installables, and using nomad cloud agents. This supports having a common surface independent of the actual backend driver being used. In addition, vault retrieval and management of cloud access credentials is\\nbeing improved to minimize any friction for the backend user."},{"id":"2023-03-31-crypto","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-03-31-crypto","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-03-31-crypto.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-31-crypto.md","title":"Crypto Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 31, 2023","tags":[{"label":"crypto","permalink":"/tags/crypto"}],"readingTime":1.105,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"I\xf1igo Querejeta Azurmendi","title":"Cardano Lead Cryptography Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iquerejeta","imageURL":"https://github.com/iquerejeta.png","key":"iquerejeta"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Crypto Team Update","slug":"2023-03-31-crypto","authors":"iquerejeta","tags":["crypto"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-04-05-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Goedel Team Update","permalink":"/2023-03-31-goedel"}},"content":"## High level summary\\nThe open fronts that the crypto team is working on are:\\n* Mithril: Started looking into full-node verifier\\n* cardano-base: BLS12-381\'s PR merged.

The backend has been equipped with the capability for genesis distribution via S3 bucket.\\n\\n# Performance\\n\\n### New tracing\\nThe new tracing system has undergone various benchmarking runs with variance analysis, and comparison to a baseline using legacy tracing. We could observe\\na slight shift in the resource usage profile from memory to CPU, but no regressions in block propagation metrics. Variance was observed to be notably smaller, which gives the new system a much better predictability. From this angle, we consider the new system fit for production use.\\n\\n### GHC RTS parametrization\\nWe\'re currently prerforming various runs on the cluster to explore the space of different GHC RTS settings for running nodes. The main focus lies\\non different configurations for the garbage collector, as well as increasing the number of CPU cores the node may use.\\n\\n### Open Sourcing\\nOur API demo has reached prototype stage, and operates on live data from the production database. Making use of the experience gained, we\'re refining version 1 of the API to provide optimized usability, and creating documentation that both is descriptive of the API endpoints, and focuses on practical, exemplary use cases.\\n\\n# Tracing\\nFor the new tracing system we\'re currently undertaking an effort to multi-layered documentation: a condensed version, as well\\nas a setup guide with pragmatical focus, will be provided alongside the in-depth documentation. This effort should cater to different audiences, and provide distinct entry points\\nfor users of the new system, depending on their wants and needs. \\n\\n# Infrastructure & Analysis\\n\\n### General\\nHaving included Conway genesis in the workbench, as a next step in future-proofing out benchmarking infrastructure, we\'re laying the foundation for a switch in compiler version to GHC 9.2. Additionally, we considered variance analysis of our runs to merit inclusion into our reporting pipeling - which will\\nincrease confidence in specific metrics.\\n\\n### Nomad backend\\nWe have implemented an appropriate mechanism for genesis distribution: Only after a benchmarking cluster has been deployed successfully, genesis\\nis patched and uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket for the nodes to retrieve - as a final step before initiating the actual run. We\'re confident that this deferred approach will provide clearer evidence for genesis patches, as well as minimize startup time for all runs by factoring in deployment re-tries."},{"id":"2023-03-21-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-03-21-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-03-21-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-21-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 21, 2023","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/tags/network"}],"readingTime":1.315,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2023-03-21-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-03-22-performance-and-tracing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Crypto Team Update","permalink":"/2023-03-17-crypto"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nIn the last spring we released `cardano-node-1.35.6` with dynamic P2P\\nfunctionality.\\n\\nWe received reports from some SPOs who encountered problems with their non\\nP2P block producing nodes not being able to connect to their P2P relay.

In\\nparticular we identified an opportunity to gain performance by handling locks in\\na more optimal way.\\n\\nOn the Genesis front, we sketched a mitigation for an issue that `PNSol` and\\nResearchers caught. We also came op with a road map for not only testing the\\nGenesis prototypes, but also for enriching the tests we already have.\\n\\nRegarding technical debt, next to some minor improvements, we created\\ncomponent-level micro-benchmarks for adding transactions to the mempool. The\\nresults of these benchmarks will be published in the `ouroboros-consensus` [web\\npage][oc-web-page].\\n\\nWe also finished moving the Consensus documentation to the `ouroboros-consensus`\\nrepository, released `ouroboros-consensus` `0.3.0.0`, and reduced the time\\nGitHub actions take in `ouroboros-network`.\\n\\n## Workstreams\\n\\n### UTxO HD Prototype\\n\\nWe continued working on refactoring and improving the UTxO-HD prototype. As a\\nresult of the first round of sytem-level benchmarks, we identified an\\nopportunity to optimise the way we handle locks to improve performance\\n([#4393][issue-4393]).\\n\\nAlso, we introduced several improvements to the `lmdb` related packages:\\n- [New tests][pull-19] for read-only transaction handles.\\n- [New functions][pull-18] and [data types][pull-13].\\n- [Updates][pull-11] to support improved type safety and smaller constraints in\\n  the UTxO HD prototype.\\n- Windows and MacOS [CI support][pull-8].\\n\\n### Genesis\\n\\nWe sketched out a mitigation of the issue that `PNSol` and Researchers caught in\\nthe Genesis design.\\n\\nWe came up with a road map for testing the Genesis prototypes, including early\\nmilestones that are applicable to today\'s master branch, ie tests that are\\nuseful before Genesis, and that will be nicely enriched when we do add Genesis.\\n\\nWe developed the aforementioned tests, specifically a `QuickCheck` generator for\\nthe Honest leader schedule and one as-aggressive-as-possible Adversarial\\nleader schedule that together satisfy the Praos properties that the Consensus\\ndesign takes as invariants.\\n\\nWe investigated why the improved `ChainDB` queueing implementation behaves\\ndifferently in the baseline compared to the prototype, and we are close to\\nhaving a full picture of how the Consensus components interact during bulk sync.\\n\\n### Technical debt\\n\\nWe [created][pull-4400] component-level micro-benchmarks for adding transactions\\nto the mempool. We plan on extending this to more mempool actions and different\\ntypes of blocks. We [store][pull-4422] the benchmark data to make it available\\nto the GitHub action that [publishes][pull-12] the benchmarks results.\\n\\nOther minor improvements include:\\n\\n- [Removal][pull-4429] of `Test.Util.Classify` in favour of `Test.StateMachine.Labelling`.\\n- [Addition][pull-4423] of `-Wunused-packages` to the default `ghc-options` for Consensus\\n  packages.\\n\\n### Fostering collaboration\\n\\nWe finished moving the Consensus documentation [from][pull-4374]\\n`ouroboros-network` [to][pull-8] `ouroboros-consensus`, in preparation for\\nmigrating the code to the latter repository.\\n\\n### Support\\n\\nWe [released][pull-4412] ouroboros-consensus 0.3.0.0.\\n\\nWe [reduced][pull-4421] the load in the `ouroboros-network` GitHub actions,\\nthereby reducing the time CI jobs take.\\n\\n[issue-4393]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4393\\n[pull-19]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/19\\n[pull-18]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/18\\n[pull-13]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/13\\n[pull-11]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/11\\n[pull-8]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-lmdb/pull/8\\n[pull-4400]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4400\\n[pull-4422]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4422\\n[pull-12]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/pull/12\\n[pull-4429]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4429\\n[pull-4423]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4423\\n[pull-4374]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4374\\n[pull-8]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/pull/8\\n[pull-4412]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4412\\n[pull-4421]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4421\\n[oc-web-page]: https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/"},{"id":"2023-03-08-node-cli-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023-03-08-node-cli-api","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2023-03-08-node-cli-api.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-08-node-cli-api.md","title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2023-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"cli-api","permalink":"/tags/cli-api"}],"readingTime":0.795,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jordan Millar","title":"Node Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/Jimbo4350","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jimbo4350.png","key":"Jimbo4350"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","slug":"2023-03-08-node-cli-api","authors":"Jimbo4350","tags":["cli-api"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2023-03-08-consensus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Performance & tracing update","permalink":"/2023-03-08-performance-and-tracing"}},"content":"# 2023-03-08 -

For SECP, we settled on a fixed tx count per block, while simultaneously spending as much as possible of the block budget. Thus we were able to minimize the impact of per-SC-call overhead.\\n2. The final runs were performed with various fractions, e.g. half, of the current block budget to ascertain how these workloads would fare compared to a value-only run.\\n3.

After analyzing initial UTxO-HD runs, it turned out that mempool snapshotting had to be throttled for benchmarking; it affects a lock that UTxO-HD had to introduce into the forging loop.\\n2.

Locality assumptions were removed and job monitoring was refactored.\\n3. To facilitate directly-executable derivations, Nomad Job specification files are now self contained with GitHub references and configs needed to run a cluster.\\n4. We\'re currently evaluating different options for genesis distribution in said cluster.\\n\\n### NixOps backend\\nThe NixOps workbench backend has reached an initial functional stage.

We found out the frequency at which ledger snapshots\\nwere taken was too high, so we requested the benchmarking team a new run with a\\nmore realistic snapshotting policy. We continued refactoring and improving the\\nprototype, and we released UTxO-HD related packages to CHaP.\\n\\nWe met with IOG researchers and networking specialists to discuss the Genesis\\ndesign, which was well received. We continued working on testing and\\nbenchmarking different Genesis prototypes.\\n\\nWe are also working on solving a test failure related to iterators. This work\\nderived in several improvements such as better documentation, a framework for\\nwriting unit (and regression) tests, and the possibility of debugging\\n`QuickCheck` counter examples in the REPL.\\n\\nFinally, we released `ouroboros-consensus` 0.2.0.0 and\\n`ouroboros-consensus-cardano` 0.3.0.0 to CHaP\\n\\n## Workstreams \\n\\n### UTxO HD Prototype \\n\\nWe got the results of the first system level benchmarks for UTxO HD. They seemed\\nto indicate a significant regression in performance. After looking into the\\nbenchmark logs we found that the benchmark runs took ledger state snapshots too\\noften, due to the default snapshotting policy depending on `k`, and `k` being so\\nsmall in the benchmark runs. Therefore, the next step is to re-run the\\nbenchmarks with a snapshotting policy that more closely resembles the one from\\nmainnet.\\n\\nAt the same time, we continued refactoring and cleaning up the prototype. \\n\\nAlso, we prepared the `anti-diff` packages (`fingertree-rm`, `diff-containers`,\\n`simple-semigroupoids`) and the `lmdb` related packages (`cardano-lmdb` and\\n`cardano-lmdb-simple`) to [CHaP][chap].\\n\\n### Genesis\\n\\nThe Genesis design was presented to the IOG researchers and Peter Thompson from\\nNSol. It was well received. They pointed out one blindspot, but we think it\'ll\\nbe relatively simple to mitigate.\\n\\nIn parallel, we continued developing test and benchmarks for the Genesis\\nprototypes. I particular we tested and implemented a potential fix for\\n[increased ChainDB dequeue timings][increased-dequeue-timings], which partly\\nbehaved as we expected, but still needs further investigation. Also we obtained\\n[new benchmarking data][new-bench-data] for the prototype.\\n\\n### Technical debt\\n\\nRelated to [#4183][pull-4183], we developed a [DSL][pull-4379] for specifying\\n`ChainDB` unit tests. This will allow us to better understand the\\ncounter-examples returned by QuickCheck tests, and to write [regression\\ntests][pull-4383] for them.

SECP benchmarking:  we ran several rounds of SECP benchmarks, refining the benchmark setup as we discovered the properties of the system.  After formulating an initial suggested change to the protocol parameters, we\'re currently running what we consider the final benchmark, to validate the underlying assumptions.\\n2. Release benchmarking:  we\'ve performed a round of benchmarks for the hotfix 1.35 release update and initiated the 1.35.6 benchmarks.\\n3. New tracing:  the improvement in the tracing API, with the underlying restructuring, was completed and merged into the node.\\n4. New tracing:  before going live, we\'re performing the documentation update, as well as reworking the end user migration guide.\\n5. Open sourcing:  the benchmarking data publishing has been completed and deployed.  After populating it with relevant benchmark data and providing basic user documentation we can go live.\\n6. Infrastructure:  the cloud workbench backend is progressing well, the networking aspects of multi-region deployment are currently being worked on.\\n7. Infrastructure:  the NixOps workbench backend is still being worked on, as part of migration from cardano-ops and benchmarking infrastructure unification.\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nWe are approaching the end of a chain of SECP benchmarks, as we gradually eliminated deficiencies in the setup as we were discovering them and answering newly appearing questions:\\n\\n- we improved the tx/block filling strategy in the generator, to maximise the per-block utilisation of resources and so better approximate the worst-case,\\n- after a discovery of what looked like significant per-SC-call overhead, we again tweaked the the tx/block filling strategy,\\n- finally, we\'re redoing all benchmarks together with a value-only run against the backdrop of Mainnet-sized datasets, to balance the suggested adjustment.  That also ran into difficulties wrt. limitations of our benchmarking hardware.\\n\\nIn addition, we started benchmarks of the 1.35.6 release.\\n\\n## Tracing\\n\\nA rework of the new tracing system\'s internals and API was merged.  It extended the system with introspection, which enabled a range of improvements, some of which were implemented along the way.\\n\\nSpecifically, we were able to completely short-cut processing of messages generated by the tracers that were made provably ineffective by current tracing configuration.  Further, now ongoing work enabled by the introspection facilities, includes static validation of documentation and enhanced node state reporting.\\n\\n## Infrastructure\\n\\nOn the opensourcing/transparency front, the benchmark data publishing machinery was finally fully assembled and put online.  As resources permit, we\'ll work on populating it with benchmarking data, preparing basic documentation and engaging the stakeholders.\\n\\nThe work on the cloud deployment capability of the Nomad workbench backend continued with focus on setting up inter-node networking and removal of locality assumptions.  A major step besides those, was completion of a switch-over to the directly-executable derivations, which eliminate the need for creation and distribution of images -- thereby increasing the speed of deployment.\\n\\nThe Nixops workbench backend progressed steadily, reaching minimal deployment capability.

We are documenting the differences with respect with the original paper.\\n* We are exploring possible paths of how mithril could be used \'as-a-service\'. Other projects such as sidechains or Catalyst would benefit of such a service. We are at a very early stage of brainstorming how it could work.\\n### cardano-base\\n* There has been a very thorough discussion with potential users of the BLS12-381 bindings if that is the best curve. We have considered alternatives such as Pasta curves, Pluto-Eris or BLS12-377, and considering it\'s trade-offs. Seems that the most interesting curve to have on main-net is still 381. \\n* The team is gaining expertise in SNARKs to be able to experiment with them, and conclude whether the bindings will allow for SNARK verification on main-net in a timely manner.\\n* The update VRF [PR#341](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/341) is finally merged, and we are ready to merge [PR#344](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/344), which implements conversion functions from the compatible types between Praos and PraosBatchCompat.\\n\\n### KES agent\\n* Use of snockets to send the data directly from the socket to secure memory. \\n* We realized that in order for the DirectSerialise / DirectDeserialise classes to work against IOSim, we have to generalize a bunch of additional primitives\\n* Our plans are to: (1) Split up MonadSodium into separate typeclasses, each capturing a more sensible concern; (2) Rename those typeclasses to something that reflects their nature better.\\n\\n### MuSig2\\nThe GitHub Action [linelint](https://github.com/fernandrone/linelint) is used to check the files.\\n* A new job for linting is added to the file `/.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The rules are configured in the file `/.github/workflows/.linelint.yml`. Some files from the configuration of `libsecp` were failing, so in the rules in `.linelint.yml` the failing files are denoted to be ignored by the linter.\\n* Folders are reorganized. We created a folder to handle the example. This folder includes the `examplemusig2.c`, a distinct `config.h`, and `helper.c`. The example is enhanced by implementing the functions in the helper for the configuration given in `config.h`.  The number of messages is different than the tests.

However, the benchmarks showed an important regression - ~30% worse on average [PR#675](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/675).

state will also be restructured in accordance with the new rules.\\nIn the conway code, we have now removed UPEC, added TALLY, and stubbed ENACTMENT.\\nWe have also adapted all the data structures in the ledger state.\\n\\nSee:\\n\\n* [pull-3216]\\n\\n### PDF hosting\\n\\nWe now build all of our PDFs using a GitHub action which is triggered by pushing a tag\\nwith a specific form, `cardano-ledger-spec-YYYY-MM-DD`.\\nThe action creates a GitHub release containing the PDFs.\\nThe links in the main ledger README now point to the PDFs in the latest release.\\n\\nSee:\\n\\n*

[here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/projects/5)).\\nWe also added a new helpful function `ensureMinCoinTxOut`.\\n\\nSee:\\n\\n* [pull-3242]\\n* [pull-3248]\\n\\n### Constraint-based generators\\n\\nOur largest scale property tests generate an initial ledger state and a long sequence of valid blocks\\nwhich span several epochs, mimicking a real network.\\nThese tests are, in theory, excellent for checking properties.\\nThey are, however, very difficult to maintain and are not as random as we would like\\n(a lot of bias has to be introduced to keep the ledger state in enough order to keep generating blocks).\\n\\nWe would like to switch to tests which instead generate a random ledger state representative\\nof not just an initial state, generate a single random valid block, and then test our properties.\\nThe hope is that these will be much more random and easier to maintain.\\n\\nWe have finished a proof of concept are encouraged that this approach could work!\\n\\nSee:\\n\\n* [pull-3219]\\n\\n### Technical debt\\n\\n* [pull-3244] massive CI speedup\\n* [pull-3249] better types for fees in the protocol parameters\\n* [pull-3264] move our annotator code to the `cardano-ledger-binary` package where it belongs\\n* [pull-3239] move the `Wdrls` type to the `Core` module.\\n\\n\\n[pull-3244]:

During\\nthese weeks we focused on cleaning and benchmarking the UTxO-HD prototype, and\\ndiscussing with the Ledger team the changes that might be required for the next\\niterations. The pull request that adds the Conway era is waiting for a second\\nreview round and we hope to merge it soon. On the technical debt side we are\\nlooking into a property-test failure found in the iterators. We are\\ninvestigating if this is an error in the model or in the implementation. We also\\nimproved the documentation of our testing code.\\n\\n## Workstreams \\n\\n### UTxO HD Prototype \\n\\nWe worked with the Ledger team to start preparing the next versions of UTxO-HD.\\nThe Ledger team is concerned that for the remaining maps we might need the full\\nledger state on epoch boundaries. Since the main consumer of the ledger rules is\\nConsensus, the code that requires access to a full state could be moved from the\\nledger to some Ledger-Consensus bridge. Eg. the traversal of rewards could take\\nplace in such bridge, instead of querying the ledger for the values that are\\nrequired in the epoch-transition computations.\\n\\nWe [relocated][pull-4234] some UTxO-HD definitions, in preparation for merging\\nthe prototype into `master`.\\n\\nWe also completed updated local benchmarks comparing the replay time and memory\\nconsumption of:\\n\\n- the baseline node (`f2fc76ef45647275c98634da1718290b976ff364`) \\n- the UTxO-HD node with the in-memory backend \\n- the UTxO-HD node with the LMDB backend\\n\\nThe following plot shows the results: we can see that the LMDB node barely\\nreaches 8GB of memory, but it takes 1.78 times longer to replay the chain. The\\nin-memory backend is about 30 minutes faster, but still slower than the baseline\\nversion. We are aware of this phenomenon and it is inherent to the problem of\\nmaintaining sequences of differences of the last `k` ledger states that allows\\nus to perform rollback and roll-forward. We are in the process of measuring\\nsyncing from scratch times.\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2023-01-11-utxo-hd-replay-benchmarks.png)\\n\\nWe also [added `StaticEither` accessors][pull-4263] that helped us to simplify\\nthe UTxO-HD prototype.\\n\\n### New Conway era\\n\\nWe incorporated the feedback of the [pull request][pull-3971], and rebased this\\nbranch on top of `master`.

Outside of testing,\\n  the ledger does not need to deal with signing keys, and since this is a topic that\\n  deserves the utmost care, it is best to make it clear that our use of signing keys\\n  is only for testing.\\n* [pull-3229] - We split the `Cardano.Ledger.Alonzo.Data` module, which is more consistent with the rest\\n  of the codebase.\\n\\n#### Revert pointer address

We also worked with the Ledger team to envisage\\nthe modifications that are required in Ledger and Consensus to accommodate the\\nchanges in the crypto VRF and KES. The `db-analyser` now supports bechmarking\\nthe ledger operations, which will allow us to identify, debug, and profile\\npotential performance problems. We drafted a document that defines how to manage\\nthe versions of Consensus-related packages. The top level documentation of\\n`ouroboros-network` now features a description of the consensus components and\\nprovides a hyperlinked map to the modules documentation.\\n\\n## Workstreams\\n\\n### UTxO HD prototype\\n\\nWhereas we had passing sequential state-machine tests for the mempool, the\\nparallel case proved to be more challenging than we thought. The operation of\\nadding a list of transactions to the mempool is not atomic and, as a result,\\nwhen adding a list of transactions, transactions from other processes can be\\nadded in between. The mempool implementation handles this correctly, however\\nthis required us to [redesign][pull-4076] the parallel model we had to take\\nthe lack of atomicity into account.\\n\\n#### Backing store property tests\\n\\nWe finished refactoring the backing store property tests. The second review\\nround is ongoing.\\n\\n### LSM tree implementation\\n\\nWe are working on benchmarking (in terms of time and number of IO operations)\\nfetching/looking up data from disk.\\n\\n### Genesis \\n\\nWe worked on the design of a mechanism to prevent a DoS attack on our Genesis\\ndesign related to rollbacks. This was arguably the biggest outstanding question.\\n\\nDuring the discussions around Genesis, we noticed a design boundary that nicely\\ndelineates a fundamental component. We almost have a full Haskell prototype of\\nit. It will be very nicely self-contained, perhaps even usable in the ultimate\\nimplementation!\\n\\n### New VRF and KES crypto integration\\n\\nWe collaborated with the Ledger team on preparing the ledger state and crypto\\ntypes to avoid huge allocation on the epoch boundary when changing aspects of\\nthe crypto that will only manifest in headers, not in the ledger states.\\n\\n### Technical debt\\n\\nWe merged the [pull-request][pull-4014] that adds a support to `db-analyser` for\\nbenchmarking ledger operations. This will allow us to identify, debug, and\\nprofile potential performance problems. The benchmark focus on the main 5 ledger\\noperations that are involved in chain syncing, block forging, and block\\nvalidation, namely:\\n\\n0. Forecast.\\n1. Header tick.\\n2. Header application.\\n3. Block tick.\\n4. Block application.\\n\\nThe following figure shows a plot of the benchmarking results for the first 65\\nmillion blocks (approximately) of the Cardano chain. The thin yellow lines under\\nthe x-axis show the epoch boundaries, whereas the thick yellow lines correspond\\nto the era transitions.\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2022-12-14-ledger-ops-benchmark.png)\\n\\nAs we can see in this figure, era and epoch boundaries require more computation\\ntime. The ledger team are aware of this problem, and we are working to improve\\nthis situation.\\n\\n### Fostering collaboration\\n\\nWe [drafted a document][pull-4207] motivating and defining how Consensus (and\\npossibly other core teams) will/should manage our package versions. This\\npull-request garnered many great discussions from our team members and other\\nteams too: Sebastian Nagel, Arnaud Bailly, Michael Peyton-Jones, Ziyang Liu, et\\nal.

SECP benchmarking enablement was completed:  we are now able to do local runs of the SECP workloads.  The next step is to port this to the AWS environment.\\n2. A new workstream for Plutus cost modeling improvement:  we\'ve planned and started implementing the smart contract call overhead measurement machinery.\\n3. The new tracing system:  after doing more benchmarking to address inter-run variance, we discovered that the regression, while still there, is small enough not to be release critical.  Nevertheless, we\'re continuing with the further performance-oriented rework of the internals.\\n4. Infrastructure:  a significant refactoring of the workbench internals was merged.  We also started improving the denotation for ever-evolving protocol parameters.  Comparative analysis of multi-run batches implementation started.\\n5. Open sourcing:  our plans matured sufficiently so that we now expect actual deployment work to start this week.\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nThe SECP benchmarking workload has been fully implemented in the workbench.  We are now porting it over to AWS, and after that we\'ll be running the model cluster workload.\\n\\nWe\'ve also started implementing mechanics for the upcoming investigation of the Plutus smart contract call overhead, which is expected to lead us to improved Plutus cost modeling.\\n\\n## Tracing\\n\\nAfter the initial model-scale performance data caused us to panic, among other things we\'ve done more benchmarks, and it turned out that inter-run variance increase was the culprit.  The actual regression averages to barely noticeable 1-2% in key metrics -- which is certainly not release critical.\\n\\nTo understand the impact of the new tracing system, we have to bear in mind the extra functionality it provides:\\n\\n  1. We are now processing all messages generated by the system, without making any shortcuts that the old system had to resort to.  That causes the new tracing to do more work, but is more useful for all users and developers involved -- since it leads to a simple, non-confusing configuration.  Incidentally, that\'s also the area where we are reworking the internals, to deduce and enable the optimisations that are implied by the particular configuration.\\n  2. The new tracing system is benchmarked with remote tracing as the default backend (whereas the old one was using local, builtin log storage mechanism).  In some sense it\'s the fair benchmark, because that\'s the way we expect SPO\'s to set up tracing.  That, however also causes it to do more work.\\n\\nAll that said, since we\'ve established the performance of the new system to be adequate for the release, we won\'t be delaying it much further.\\n\\nIn addition, we\'re still pursuing our performance-enhancing rework of the new tracing internals.\\n\\n## Infrastructure\\n\\nAfter implementing the multi-backend capability in the workbench, we got the opportunity to reassess the generic/backend boundaries and perform some long-awaited cleanups and simplifications in that area.

In the\\nlast update, we informed about a performance regression, but it turns out it\\nonly affects block producers, and thus we highly advise against running it on\\nsuch nodes.  Further investigation is required to find the cause of it.\\n\\nOn IOG\'s benchmarking cluster we have seen quite a good performance improvement\\non block propagation itself.  The cluster is running a static topology with\\nvalency 6 (each node is connected to 6 other nodes).  In which every of the 50\\nnodes are block producers.  The setup of this network is the same as mainnet.\\nWe\'ve seen 40-50% performance improvement on block propagation comparing to the\\nsame cluster deployed with the same topology but using non-P2P nodes.  We think\\nthis performance improvement is caused by using full duplex connections.  Quite\\nlikely the transaction traffic floating in both directions on the same TCP\\nconnection helps to keep the TCP window open.  Note that in a cluster of 50\\nnodes with valency 6 the probability of having at least one duplex connection\\nis more than 50%.

As\\npart of our work on UTxO HD, we improved the Haskell support for LMDB. We also\\nspent time working on the LSM tree prototype, and designed a parameter tuning\\nalgorithm for it. Regarding our work on Genesis, our investigation of the\\n\\"plateaus\\" pointed at the `TICKF` slowdown on era boundaries as culprit. This\\nled us to developing a caching strategy that will not only remove the\\naforementioned \\"plateaus\\", but can help alleviating the growing block production\\ndelay on epoch switch. We also helped reviewing the block forge credential\\nhotswap feature, which is intended for use in the adoption of P2P.\\n\\nWe also worked on paying technical debt and fostering collaboration. In\\nparticular, we improved the `io-sim` framework, which is crucial for testing and\\nsimulating Cardano components. We also removed thunks that appeared on era\\ntranslations, and improved our diffusion pipelining feature. We are working on a\\npresentation for explaining Praos and Genesis.\\n\\n## High-level status report\\n\\n- Finish the UTxO HD prototype: in progress.\\n  - We added documentation for this feature.\\n  - We developed the second version of the mempool tests.\\n  - We fixed benchmarks that were inflating the speedup we observed in the\\n    anti-diff implementation of sequences of differences. Speedups are now in the\\n    range of [3.33, 4.75], which remain significant.\\n  - We continued improving Haskell LMDB support.\\n  - We finished implementing a \\"parameter tuning algorithm\\" for the LSM tree\\n    prototype. This enables us to run experiments to check the correctness of\\n    the algorithm.\\n- Genesis: in progress.\\n  - Work investigating the \\"plateaus\\" in the `ChainSync` jumping prototype\\n    pointed to the `TICKF` slowdown on era boundaries as culprit.\\n- Tech debt:\\n  - We improved the capabilities of our `io-sim` library, which is crucial for\\n    testing and simulating Cardano components.\\n  - We removed thunks from epoch translations in the ledger.\\n  - We added Linux CI support for `lmdb-simple`.\\n  - We got pending diffusion pipelining improvements merged.\\n- Fostering collaboration:\\n  - We are working on a explanation of Praos and Genesis protocols.\\n- Support:\\n  - Investigation of CSJ \\"plateaus\\" led us to developing a caching strategy for\\n    `TICKF` that will not only remove these \\"plateaus\\", but can help alleviating\\n    the growing block production delay on epoch switch.\\n  - We reviewed the block forge credential hotswapping feature which is intended\\n    for use in the adoption of P2P.\\n\\n## Workstreams\\n\\n### Finish the UTxO HD prototype\\n\\nWe merged PR [#4060][pr-4060], which adds a report documenting the UTxO HD\\nfeature, and puts emphasis in explaining how the mempool works in combination\\nwith UTxO HD.\\n\\nWe opened a draft PR with the second iteration of the property tests for the\\nmempool ([#4076][pr-4076]).\\n\\nWe fixed the `Arbitrary` instances for keys and values in `DiffSeq` benchmarks\\n([#4143][pr-4143]). The problem was that we were testing with mostly small\\nvalues, which artificially boosted the performance gains we saw on benhcmarks.\\nSpeedups are now in the range of [3.33, 4.75] across the different\\nconfigurations.\\n\\n#### Backing store property tests\\n\\nWe focused on incorporating feedback on the monadic cursor API PR ([#1][pr-1]).\\nThis required us to make small tweaks to `quickcheck-lockstep` to test the new\\nAPI. We also updated the backing store property tests to use the new version of\\nthe monadic cursor API.\\n\\n### LSM tree implementation\\n\\nWe worked on the LSM tree prototype. In particular: finished implementing a\\n\\"parameter tuning algorithm\\" that adapts the LSM tree design based on factors\\nlike:\\n- workload\\n- machine specs, \\n- and characteristics of the data being stored. \\n\\nWe are now running experiments to gather results and cross-reference them with\\nexisting experimental results from the LSM tree paper to see if the algorithm is\\nworking correctly.\\n\\n### Benchmarking the CSJ prototype\\n\\nWe focused on investigating the \\"plateaus\\" in the `ChainSync` tip, which turned\\nout to be due to the `TICKF` bug which we previously were only aware of in the\\ncontext of the long forging times near epoch boundaries. For the most drastic\\npatch by @nfrisby to speed up `TICKF`, full sync is speeding up by 7%.\\n\\nThe following plot shows that by caching the `TICKF` the `ChainSync` tip and the\\n`VolatileDB` tip progress at the same rate.\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2022-11-16-removed-stuttering.png)\\n\\nThe plot below shows the speedup observed by caching the `TICKF` rule wrt the\\nbaseline.\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2022-11-16-comparing-TICKF-batch.png)\\n\\n### Technical debt\\n\\nAfter addressing the PR comments, we merged PR [#16][pr-16], which implements\\nthe `MonadCatch` instance for `STM`. This extends the capability of our `io-sim`\\nlibrary, which is crucial for testing and simulating Cardano components PR #16\\nclosed [#1461][issue-1461]. This new feature was published as version `0.4.0.0`\\nof `io-sim`.\\n\\nWe continued with our work fixing the `NoThunk` errors required for enabling\\nnightly tests, with the help of `TVarInvariant` checks in `strict-stm` and\\n`nothunks` libraries. We proposed fixes in `cardano-ledger` that took care of\\nthunks that appeared in era translations ([#3143][pr-3143]). The fixes will be\\nintegrated back into consensus when `cardano-ledger` approves and publish the\\nchanges introduced in `#3143`.\\n\\nWe added CI support for `lmdb-simple` ([#2][pr-2]).

The next steps are:\\n\\n- Improve error handling and command generation.\\n- Add coverage testing to check that we are not failing to cover interesting\\n  test cases.\\n\\nThe [monadic cursor API](https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/1)\\nwent through its first review round.

This will involve adding boilerplate code in consensus to make up for\\n  the removal of the `cborg`-based interface.\\n\\n## LSM tree implementation\\n\\nWe worked on the [LSM tree\\nprototype](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4121). In\\nparticular, we focused on tuning the LSM tree design to the different workloads\\nthat consensus has (eg syncing, normal node operation, etc).\\n\\n### Benchmarking the CSJ prototype\\n\\nWork on improving the chain-sync jumping performance is ongoing. In particular\\nwe compared the performance of different jump intervals, which, somewhat\\nsurprisingly, do not make a significant difference. In particular, we are seeing\\nperiodic \\"plateaus\\" where the chain-sync tip does not progress, but they are\\nmuch longer for the prototype. Our hypothesis is that this seem to be due to a\\ncombination of the garbage collector (GC) pauses, and the actual time it takes\\nthe non-dynamo chain-sync peers to jump to the tip of the slot of the dynamo\\nfragment.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks we will try to shorten these plateaus via a combination of\\ntweaking GC options and less synchronisation in the CSJ governor.\\n\\nThe following plot shows the performance of the chain-sync jumping prototype\\nusing different jumping intervals. It compares the syncing progress by plotting\\nthe slots of adopted blocks against time. The baseline is still faster, however\\nit is worth noting that the current prototype already achieves a significant\\nspeedup when compared to the naive approach of simply running full chain-sync\\nwith all peers.\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2022-11-02-csj-vs-baseline.svg)\\n\\nThe second plot shows the syncing progress sliced to a chosen ~5min interval,\\nand includes, in addition to the slots of adopted blocks, the slots of the tip\\nof the ChainSync fragment. This allows us to see how far ahead of the selected\\ntip the CS dynamo is, i.e. how much room we have for BlockFetch not to get\\nstalled. It shows periodic behaviour (due to the forecasting limit), and shows\\nthat the CS fragment tip is not progressing for significant periods\\n(\\"plateaus\\").\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2022-11-02-csj-vs-baseline-sliced.svg)\\n\\n## Technical debt\\n\\nWe [clarified](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4098) a\\ncommon source of confusion around VRF tie-breaking and cross-era chain\\nselection. This PR involved correcting potentially misleading names of\\nVRF-related functions, and providing context for a particular VRF value is\\nused for tie-breaking."},{"id":"2022-11-02-ledger","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022-11-02-ledger","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2022-11-02-ledger.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-02-ledger.md","title":"Ledger Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2022-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"ledger","permalink":"/tags/ledger"}],"readingTime":2.275,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jared Corduan","title":"Ledger Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/JaredCorduan","imageURL":"https://github.com/JaredCorduan.png","key":"JaredCorduan"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","slug":"2022-11-02-ledger","authors":"JaredCorduan","tags":["ledger"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2022-10-02-consensus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Node API & CLI Team Update","permalink":"/2022-11-02-node-cli-api"}},"content":"## High level summary\\nWe have made the decision to use the\\n[formal ledger repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications)\\nin place of a LaTeX spec for the next ledger era, and have added a lot of basic infrastructure\\nto the model.

We wrote a PR which rules out such misconfiguration.  We are awaiting on\\nthe next benchmarking results.

We finished a prototype for performance data publishing.  We almost finished the local deployment backend for the workbench using the new SRE deployment infra.  We worked on fixing and improving our data analysis pipeline.\\n\\nOn the tracing side, the team worked on isolating a critical issue causing message loss in the remote tracing backend.  The issue was resolved and we now have proper end-to-end coverage for the scenario.\\n\\n## Executive summary\\n\\n- The new tracing system public release is getting closer, as we\'re resolving remaining rough edges that are discovered in full-scale deployments.  The local benchmarks we ran were already showing improvement relative to legacy tracing, so we expect similar results at full scale.\\n- The first (local deployment) iteration of benchmarking adopting the new SRE deployment infra is nearly done.  We thank Michael Fellinger and Robin Stumm for their assistance.  Two further phases remain:  CI integration and cloud deployment.\\n- The benchmarking data publishing prototype is ready.  This serves as a springboard for both opening our performance assessment workflow (to support the wider Cardano developer community), and for data provision to the business community.  Our next steps are to secure a permanent deployment for this mechanism and to integrate it into the benchmarking infrastructure.

Thanks to these tests we were able to uncover a bug in the\\nprototype. On the Genesis front, we benchmarked a different version of the\\nChainSync jumping prototype to try to improve its performance, but this did not\\nresult in any noticeable speedup.\\n\\n## High-level status report\\n\\n- Finish the UTxO HD prototype: on track.\\n  - We focused on increasing test coverage for the UTxO-HD prototype:\\n    - We started implementing Cadano-eras transition property-tests.\\n    - We started implementing state-machine property-tests for the mempool.\\n    - We merged the mempool rewrite.\\n    - We started working on state-machine tests for the backing store. This\\n      uncovered a bug in the range-read implementation of the LMDB backing\\n      store.\\n- Genesis: on track.\\n  - We benchmarked a version of the Genesis ChainSync Jumping prototype that\\n    spreads out the ChainSync updates over a longer period of time. This did not\\n    result in any noticeable speedup.\\n  - We investigated the overhead introduced by non-ChainSync components, but no\\n    conclusions could be drawn from the benchmarks we ran.\\n\\n## Workstreams\\n\\n### Finish the UTxO HD prototype\\n\\nWe focused on increasing test coverage for the UTxO HD prototype. We also merged\\nthe [mempool\\nrewrite](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4049).\\n\\n#### Era transition property tests\\n\\nWe started implementing [Cardano era transition property\\ntests](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4043),\\nwhich are needed for making sure that the ledger tables get updated in the\\nright way when we move from one era to the next. There are at the moment two\\nimportant transitions.\\n- Byron to Shelley: where all the UTxO is transferred from in-memory Byron\\n  state (which has no tables) to the ledger tables of the Shelley state.\\n- Shelley to Allegra: where the AVVM addresses must be deleted.\\n\\nWe have tests for the Byron to Shelley transitions. We are working on adding\\nthe remaining ones.\\n\\n#### Mempool state-machine tests\\n\\nWe started implementing [state-machine property tests for the\\nmempool](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4044).\\nThe mempool is currently tested via pure property tests, and use a ledger\\nstate without tables. With the introduction of UTxO HD, testing the concurrent\\nbehavior of the mempool became of crucial importance (eg now we have to\\nacquire locks to flush the backing store). In addition, we need to test a\\nledger state with tables. These needs led to the creation of a new set of\\nproperty tests. In particular we aim to run parallel state-machine tests that\\nexercise the mempool in a way similar to how the node would make use of it.\\n\\n#### Backing store property tests\\n\\nWe started working on [state-machine tests for the backing\\nstore](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4081) that UTxO\\nHD uses. The property tests uncovered errors in the range-reads implementation\\nof the LMDB backing store. To facilitate fixing this bug, we made\\n[changes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/1) to the Haskell\\nLMDB bindings.\\n\\n### Benchmarking the CSJ prototype\\n\\nPrompted by previous benchmarks showing significant improvements in sync time by\\nusing more capabilities, we implemented a way to spread out the ChainSync\\nupdates over a larger period instead of firing them all at the same time. This\\ndidn\'t result in a noticeable speedup.\\n\\nWe also benchmarked the prototype with CSJ disabled (such that just the dynamo\\npeer is running ChainSync, but e.g. BlockFetch still sees all peers) to rule\\nout/confirm overhead by non-ChainSync (mainly BlockFetch) related components.\\nThis results in era-specific behavior (speed is like the prototype in Byron, but\\nlike the baseline in Shelley). This deserves a closer look in the future.\\n\\nThis diagram shows the respective syncing progress, starting at Genesis and\\ncontinuing a good part into Shelley (with the dashed line indicating the\\nByron-to-Shelley transition).\\n\\n - Red: baseline\\n - Green: CSJ prototype, 10 peers, jumps every 3000/f slots, jumps in clumps.\\n - Blue: like Green, jumps are spread out.\\n - Orange: variant with no jumping, to measure unrelated overhead.\\n\\n![](/images/happy-path-csj-prototype-bench-2.svg)"},{"id":"2022-10-14-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022-10-14-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2022-10-14-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-14-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2022-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":1.26,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Hydra Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2022-10-14-hydra","authors":"ch1bo","tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2022-10-18-consensus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/2022-10-14-ledger"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThis week, the hydra team worked on implementing ADR18 to get backup & restore functionality of the `hydra-node` over the line.

This has been\\n one of db-sync main objectives for this period.

For example `RollForward Int` will forge a new block\\nthat fits on the current chain. These real commands are executed against db-sync using the mock\\nchain-sync server. The symbolic commands are executed against a vesy simplistic Model of db-sync\\nwhich looks like this:\\n\\n``` haskell\\n  Model\\n    { serverTip :: BlockNo\\n    , dbSyncTip :: BlockNo\\n    , dbSynsIsOn :: Bool\\n    , dbSynsHasSynced :: Bool\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nFinally a number of postconditions are checked, related to the eventual block number of db-sync.\\n\\n### Tech Debt\\n\\nWe handled a number of tech debt in\\n [1275](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/pull/1275)\\n This improves the code format of db-sync, deletes many queries that were never used and groups the\\n others.

While this\\n  fixed the problems observed when running local benchmarks, it broke the\\n  `ThreadNet` tests due to concurrency issues. Therefore, we think it is wise to\\n  start redesigning the UTxO HD mempool integration.\\n- We did several rounds of code review on the alternative implementation of\\n  diff-sequences required by the UTxO HD feature based on the idea of\\n  anti-diffs. This alternative implementation is close to being merged, and the\\n  next step is to integrate this to the UTxO HD branch, so that we can run\\n  ad-hoc replaying and syncing from scratch benchmarks and compare these with\\n  the baseline. The micro-benchmarks we elaborated for the alternative\\n  implementation show speedups of up to 4x, so we are optimistic about the\\n  performance of replaying and syncing from scratch benchmarks, however it is\\n  important to notice that *due to the nature of UTxO HD* we will still be\\n  slower than the baseline.\\n- The final draft of the Genesis implementation specification is ready for\\n  review.\\n- We implemented a prototype for the happy path of Genesis\' ChainSync Jumping\\n  (CSJ). The prototype is slower than the baseline, however it is not the latest\\n  version of the prototype and the jump interval is very small.\\n- Work on integrating Conway has [stopped][nicks-comment-conway] since\\n  priorities have changed.\\n- We started work on benchmarking epoch-boundaries and epoch overhead\\n  [pr-4014][pr-4014]. To this end, we made use of a modified version of our\\n  `db-analyser` tool. We ran the new benchmarking setup using the Cardano\\n  mainnet chain, and we can see that block tick and application take\\n  substantially longer at epoch boundaries, although there are a couple of slots\\n  during an epoch in which these computations take more than normal. We notified\\n  the ledger team about these findings. We will use this modified version of\\n  `db-analyser` to investigate the epoch overhead.\\n\\n\\n# Workstreams\\n\\n## UTxO HD\\n\\n - Spent quite some time investigating the root cause of the degradation in\\n   performance observed in the benchmarks.

These servers are offered\\n      jump requests via the ChainSync protocol (hence the name), which they can\\n      accept or decline. If a peer declines, the Genesis rule allows us to\\n      determine whether a node actually has a better chain.\\n\\n    - The \\"happy path\\" is when no peer declines a jump.

As a result, a new technical debt\\n   issue was raised, which does not block the integration of the Conway era\\n   ([Issue #3976][issue-3976]).\\n\\n### UTxO HD\\n\\n- [Issue #3954][issue-3954], [branch][branch-3954]: The functionality of a\\n  backing store, which is the interface to the on-disk part of ledger state in\\n  UTxO-HD, is tested at a high level through the `OnDisk` tests. However, some\\n  functionalities remain untested, e.g., reads of ranges of keys. As such, we\\n  have implemented `quickcheck-state-machine` tests that exercise backing stores\\n  directly. The tests are reusable for different backing store implementations\\n  because the tests are implementation-agnostic: Any backing store that conforms\\n  to the backing store interface can be plugged into the tests. Work is still\\n  ongoing to label/monitor the tests, such that we can verify that interesting\\n  cases are being tested. Furthermore, a possible bug has been identified in the\\n  LMDB backing store with respect to range reads, though the bug has not been\\n  resolved yet.\\n- [Issue #3946][issue-3946], [branch][branch-4199], [PR #3882][pull-3882]: The\\n  \\"anti-diff\\" prototype proposes an alternative approach to keeping track of\\n  sequences (more specifically, `FingerTree`s) of diffs. These diff sequences\\n  are a component of the in-memory parts of the ledger state in UTxO-HD. Since\\n  the consensus code often requires the cumulative diff of a sequence of diffs,\\n  the current implementation \\"caches\\" cumulative diffs of each subtree in the\\n  diff sequence. This caching allows relatively fast reconstruction of the total\\n  cumulative diff, but this caching proved to incur a non-negligible cost: when\\n  we manipulate diff sequences through splits and appends, we force re-computing\\n  a logarithmic number of caches. This is problematic, since we often split and\\n  append in consensus: we split when we flush diffs to a backing store or when\\n  we roll back blocks, and we append when pushing blocks. The new approach\\n  should reduce the overhead of this caching.\\n\\n  We implemented micro-benchmarks for the \\"anti-diff\\" prototype: we\\n  first generate a sequence of commands (`Forward`, `Push`, `Flush`, or\\n  `Rollback`) through a simulation, after which we measure the performance of\\n  applying the commands to a diff sequence. In this context, `Forward` means\\n  forwarding of values through a diff, whereas `Rollback` means switching to\\n  a different fork by rolling back diffs/blocks and pushing new ones.\\n  Moreover, we compare the performance for the two implementations: the\\n  \\"legacy\\" approach, and the anti-diff approach.\\n\\n  Some preliminary results were positive, but we needed to revisit the\\n  benchmark\'s configuration to obtain more definitive results. After a\\n  discussion with @dcoutts and the consensus team about this configuration\\n  (e.g., number of commands generated, choice of the security parameter `k`),\\n  the benchmarks should now be closer to the realistic setting. The following\\n  configuration specifies the default configuration that is used in the\\n  benchmarking code:\\n  * Number of commands generated: `10_000`\\n  * Security parameter `k`: `2160`\\n  * Number of initial backing values: `100`\\n  * Number of key-value pairs deleted by a push: `50`\\n  * Number of key-value pairs inserted by a push: `50`\\n  * Number of key-value pairs forwarded by a forward: `50`\\n  * Probability of a large (in the range `[1000, 2000]`) rollback: `0.05`\\n  * Probability of a small (in the range `[1, 10]`) rollback: `0.95`\\n  * Order of commands:\\n    * An equal number of forward and pushes.\\n    * `1` flush every `10` pushes.\\n    * `1` rollback every `100` pushes\\n\\n  Moreover, we run four benchmark scenarios:\\n  * Default configuration\\n  * Without rollbacks\\n  * With only small rollbacks\\n  * Without rollbacks, larger flushes (`1` flush every `100` pushes)\\n\\n  ### How to read results\\n\\n  Note: this section uses documentation from the\\n  [tasty-bench](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-bench) package to\\n  explain how to read the results of running our benchmarks.\\n\\n  Running a benchmark scenario gives us the following (curated) output:\\n  ```text\\n  ...\\n  AntiDiff:                               OK (18.27s)\\n    2.527 s \xb1  47 ms, 2.1 GB allocated, 544 MB copied, 2.2 GB peak memory, 0.23x\\n  LegacyDiff:                             OK (32.73s)\\n    10.829 s \xb1 148 ms, 6.8 GB allocated, 2.3 GB copied, 2.2 GB peak memory\\n  ...\\n  ```\\n\\n  The output says that the first benchmark, which exercises the anti-diff\\n  prototype, was repeatedly executed for `18.27` seconds (wall-clock time),\\n  its predicted mean CPU time was `2.527` seconds and means of individual\\n  samples do not often diverge from it further than `\xb1 47` milliseconds\\n  (double standard deviation). We also configure the RTS to collect GC\\n  statistics, which enables `tasty-bench` to estimate and report memory usage.\\n  This data is reported as per `RTSStats` fields: `allocated_bytes`,\\n  `copied_bytes` and `max_mem_in_use_bytes`. So, the output of the first\\n  benchmark says that a total of `2.1 GB` of memory was allocated, that a\\n  total of `544 MB` of memory were copied, and that the peak memory in usage\\n  was `2.2 GB`. We read the output for the second benchmark in the same way.\\n\\n  Furthermore, the benchmark compares the mean CPU times for\\n  both the anti-diff and legacy approaches: In this case, the mean CPU time\\n  for the anti-diff approach is `~0.23x` the mean CPU time for the legacy\\n  approach. Conversely, the mean CPU time for the legacy approach is\\n  `1 / 0.23 ~= 4.35x` the mean CPU time for the anti-diff approach. We will\\n  call `0.23x` the *improvement factor*. We will call `4.35x` the *speedup*.\\n\\n  Note that these improvement factors (and reported results) are subject to\\n  noise, randomness, the specific configuration parameters, and the whims\\n  of statistics. Data reported by `tasty-bench` is only of indicative and\\n  comparative significance.\\n\\n  ### Results\\n\\n  For each of the 4 scenarios, we list the results of running the anti-diff and\\n  legacy approaches 5 times. We run the benchmarks 5 times to get an indication\\n  of whether the results are similar across multiple runs. Furthermore, we\\n  calculate the accompanying *ranges* (if applicable) of improvement factors and\\n  speedups.\\n\\n  Note also the decrease in total bytes allocated and total bytes copied for\\n  the anti-diff approach compared to the legacy approach.\\n\\n  #### Default configuration\\n\\n  |Name|Mean CPU time|2*Stdev (CPU time)|Total bytes allocated|Total bytes copied|Peak memory|\\n  |-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n  |Run 1: AntiDiff|2.533 s (0.23x)|4.7 ms|2.1 GB|557 MB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 1: LegacyDiff|10.792 s|162 ms|6.8 GB|2.3 GB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 2: AntiDiff|2.508 s (0.23x)|245 ms|2.1 GB|515 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 2: LegacyDiff|10.850 s| 30 ms|6.9 GB|2.3 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: AntiDiff|2.562 s (0.23x)|5.0 ms|2.1 GB|552 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: LegacyDiff|10.993 s|149 ms|6.9 GB|2.3 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 4: AntiDiff|2.168 s (0.22x)|5.3 ms|1.8 GB|434 MB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 4: LegacyDiff|9.976 s| 39 ms|6.3 GB|2.0 GB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 5: AntiDiff|2.527 s (0.23x)| 47 ms|2.1 GB|544 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 5: LegacyDiff|10.829 s|148 ms|6.8 GB|2.3 GB|2.2 GB|\\n\\n  * Improvement factor: `[0.22, 0.23]`\\n  * Speedup : `[1 / 0.23 ~= 4.35, 1 / 0.22 ~= 4.55]`\\n\\n  #### No rollbacks\\n\\n  |Name|Mean CPU time|2*Stdev (CPU time)|Total bytes allocated|Total bytes copied|Peak memory|\\n  |-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n  |Run 1: AntiDiff|1.638 s (0.19x)| 36 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 1: LegacyDiff|8.656 s|207 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 2: AntiDiff|1.638 s (0.19x)| 75 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 2: LegacyDiff|8.654 s|322 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: AntiDiff|1.663 s (0.19x)| 74 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: LegacyDiff|8.799 s|216 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 4: AntiDiff|1.645 s (0.19x)| 51 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 4: LegacyDiff|8.732 s|261 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 5: AntiDiff|1.639 s (0.19x)| 19 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 5: LegacyDiff|8.653 s|234 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n\\n  * Improvement factor: `0.19`\\n  * Speedup : `1 / 0.19 ~= 5.25`\\n\\n\\n  #### Only small rollbacks\\n\\n  |Name|Mean CPU time|2*Stdev (CPU time)|Total bytes allocated|Total bytes copied|Peak memory|\\n  |-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n  |Run 1: AntiDiff|1.833 s (0.18x)| 36 ms|1.5 GB|185 MB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 1: LegacyDiff|10.362 s|867 ms|5.8 GB|1.6 GB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 2: AntiDiff|1.696 s (0.19x)| 30 ms|1.5 GB|185 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 2: LegacyDiff|8.822 s|106 ms|5.8 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: AntiDiff|1.702 s (0.19x)| 44 ms|1.5 GB|186 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: LegacyDiff|8.906 s|147 ms|5.8 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 4: AntiDiff|1.701 s (0.19x)| 47 ms|1.5 GB|185 MB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 4: LegacyDiff|8.949 s|197 ms|5.8 GB|1.5 GB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 5: AntiDiff|1.677 s (0.19x)| 55 ms|1.5 GB|186 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 5: LegacyDiff|8.856 s|177 ms|5.8 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n\\n  * Improvement factor: `[0.18, 0.19]`\\n  * Speedup : `[1 / 0.19 ~= 5.25, 1 / 0.18 ~= 5.55]`\\n\\n  #### No rollbacks, larger flushes (every 100 pushes)\\n\\n  |Name|Mean CPU time|2*Stdev (CPU time)|Total bytes allocated|Total bytes copied|Peak memory|\\n  |-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n  |Run 1: AntiDiff|1.643 s (0.25x)| 21 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 1: LegacyDiff|6.591 s|351 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 2: AntiDiff|1.616 s (0.25x)| 47 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 2: LegacyDiff|6.520 s|232 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: AntiDiff|1.640 s (0.25x)| 34 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: LegacyDiff|6.540 s|150 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 4: AntiDiff|1.635 s (0.25x)| 76 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 4: LegacyDiff|6.589 s|131 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 5: AntiDiff|1.628 s (0.25x)| 19 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 5: LegacyDiff|6.490 s|5.9 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.2 GB|\\n\\n  * Improvement factor: `0.25`\\n  * Speedup : `1 / 0.25 ~= 4`\\n\\n### Genesis\\n\\n - We elaborated a draft of the specification of the Genesis implementation and\\n   the ChainSync Jumping optimization. In particular, this includes a proof\\n   sketch that the latter preserves liveness and safety in all cases ([Issue\\n   3964][issue-3964]).\\n      - @nfrisby\'s main realization during this sprint was that he had been\\n        focusing so far on the case where the selected chain is an extension of\\n        the intersection of our peers\' ChainSync candidates.\\n      - This is the main case, ie an \\"absorbing\\" state, but it\'s not the only\\n        case.\\n      - The new proof sketch begins by case splitting on that predicate, and\\n        that made the sketch quite a bit easier to follow.\\n - We continued working on the \\"happy path\\" `ChainSync` Jumping prototype ([Issue\\n   3960][issue-3960]).\\n\\n### Technical debt\\n\\n - We started working on the issues required to re-enable nightly CI runs..\\n   Nightly CI runs have far more lax time constraints, which gives the option to\\n   run significantly more property tests than in our regular CI. To this end, we\\n   merged a PR to easily adapt the number of tests globally ([PR\\n   #3947][pull-3947]).\\n\\n[issue-3954]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3954\\n[branch-3954]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/tree/jdral/3954-backingstore-property-tests\\n[issue-3946]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3946\\n[branch-4199]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/tree/jdral/CAD-4199-prototype-anti-diffs\\n[pull-3882]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3882\\n[pull-3947]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3947\\n[issue-3960]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3960\\n[issue-3962]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3962\\n[issue-3964]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3964\\n[pull-3971]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3971\\n[issue-3976]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3976"},{"id":"2022-08-12-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022-08-12-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2022-08-12-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-12-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"The networking team took an active part in the project iteration (PI) planning","date":"2022-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 12, 2022","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/tags/network"}],"readingTime":0.88,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2022-08-12-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/2022-08-31-consensus"}},"content":"```mdx-code-block\\nimport  ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe networking team took an active part in the project iteration (PI) planning\\nsession, see cardano-node [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/39) for detailed\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n* We started working on a detailed design / implementation plan for gossip.\\n\\n* We merged [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3859](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3859) which\\n  sets the ouroboros-network repository for the single relay release.\\n\\n* We identified a bug in the network simulator, which is fixed in the\\n  [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3852](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3852).\\n  The above PR was reviewed.\\n\\n* We set the tracing configuration for nodes which we deploy and fixed and\\n  identified some deployment hiccups.

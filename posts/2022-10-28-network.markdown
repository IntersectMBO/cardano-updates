# High-level summary

## P2P Network Stack

During the past two weeks the team focused on p2p single relay release and peer
sharing.  We found and fixed an important bug recently introduced in one of the
components of p2p networking stack (fortunately never released).  Together with
a fix, we designed a unit test diffusion simulation as well as quickcheck
property test (both could reproduce it). We also changed the code in a way that
if such a bug is reintroduced in the future, it will be obvious to diagnose.

Initial benchmarking run of the P2P code was executed.  The results where
unlike what we see on the mainnet.  We found a possible misconfiguration of the
cluster (caused by 0 TTL on domain names), which could be the direct cause of
it.  We wrote a PR which rules out such misconfiguration.  We are awaiting on
the next benchmarking results.

We also started working on P2P single relay release.  The PR
[ouroboros-network#4120](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4120)
includes _108_ patches cherry-picked from the `master` branch.  We started
working toward integration these changes against the release branch of
`cardano-node`.  Early next week we ought to be able to have an early version
of `cardano-node` with _non experimental P2P support_!

## Consensus

We identified and fixed missing error reporting in consensus
initialisation phase.

## Cardano Node

We also made changes in `cardano-node` in order to give better experience for
node operators.  This includes updating severities of some of the traces as
well as implementing new format of the p2p topology file.

## Peer Sharing

We continued working on implementation of peer sharing.  We have an early
implementation which will be reviewed and analysed in next weeks.  We started
working on `cardano-node` integration.  We need
[PR #4392](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/4392) to be merged
before such integration will be able to land in `cardano-node`, although this
is _not blocking_ us currently.

## Eclipse Evasion

We held a session which included Alexander Russel, Sandro Coretti-Drayton and
Nick Frisby from the consensus team.  We discussed high lever design of the
eclipse evasion scheme, which is important for the design and implementation of
`ouroboros-genesis`.  We got a positive feedback from the researchers.

## IO-Sim

In this period we made little progress towards releasing `IO-Sim` on Hackage.
A single [PR](https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/pull/32) which added
a few missing instances of the `STM` monad.

## Open Source

We made sure the CI runs for PRs which comes from forks (which is important to
accept contributions from 3rd parties).

# Additional information

## P2P Single Relay Release

The bug was caused by a blocking action which caused locked hot peers of the
outbound governor, even if the bearer errored.  The fixed and tests where implemented in:

* [ouroboros-network#4067](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4067)
* [ouroboros-network#4086](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4086)

The DNS TTL issue was solved in:

* [ouroboros-network#4106](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4106)

## Consensus

The early error reporting of consensus was addressed in

* [ouroboros-network#4015](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4015)

## Cardano Node

The new topology format is in review:

* [cardano-node#4563](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/4563)

Tracing improvements:

* [cardano-node#4561](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/4561)

## Peer Sharing

* [ouroboros-network#4019](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4019)

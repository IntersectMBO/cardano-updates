# High level summary

The SRE team is heavily working on the Equinix Metal migration, replacing Hydra
with Cicero, and a new version of Spongix.

# Lower level summary

## OpenZiti

- Work is ongoing on our OpenZiti integration into Bitte in [[bitte-zt]].
- CI-World deployment of Darwin CI Ziti service in [[ci-world-commit-d40f4d]].
- Multiple issues filed, and a lot of discussion with the OpenZiti developers,
  we're making pretty rapid progress thanks to them.
- Work on getting Equinix baremetal machines integrated into AWS World Bitte
  clusters utilizing a Ziti ZTNA network overlay to bridge the networking of
  the two environments and get IAM extension to Equinix machine for Nomad
  client onboarding.
- A Nix Flake for most of our OpenZiti dependencies including the Console,
  Controller, Edge Tunnel, and Router is now at [[openziti-bins]].
- The Flake also includes a WiP NixOS modules for these components.
- Tested Ziti Desktop Edge official app for Darwin x86_64 w/ GUI -- works with
  no issues seen so far
- Moved the console to traefik routing service (`zac.$DOMAIN`) and
  controller/edge router stay at `zt.$DOMAIN`, but have registered consul
  services

## Cicero & Tullia Integrations

- Added webhook for [[haskell.nix]].
- Finished Cicero CI action for [[cardano-addresses-pull-205]].
- Fixed cardano-prelude cicero action in [[cardano-prelude-pull-176]].
- Fixed the `abcird-stdlib/publish` action [[abcirdc-pull-104]]
- fix error on vm-bigdisk flake configs [[cicero-pull-66]].
- Helped with Cicero actions and answered questions for [[plutus]]
  [[cardano-prelude]], and [[abcirdc]].
- Merged [[cardano-base-pull-323]] for Tullia on cardano-base.
- Merged Cicero action in [[cardano-ogmios-pull-5]].
- Opened [[cardano-explorer-app-pull-427]] to add Tullia and Cicero.
- Opened [[cardano-ledger-pull-3097]] to add Cicero CI action.
- Opened [[cardano-node-pull-4489]] to add Tullia and Cicero, including
  OS-agnostic jobs.
- Opened [[ouroboros-network-pull-4108]] to add Cicero action.
- Reviewed [[plutus-pull-4918]] and helped test it.
- Update Tullia in [[abcirdc-pull-97]] to build if a tag is given.

## Cicero & Tullia Features

- Improvements to Tullia task aggregation to make [[cardano-addresses]] build
  correctly.
- Better tullia CUE lib default for tags [[tullia-commit-4df3c5d]].
- Put `cache.nixos.org` back in `cache.iog.io`'s upstreams. This is now
  considered a public cache again, and without it some Cicero evaluations had
  to build huge packages.
- Started working on a flake-parts module for Tullia.
- Started working on cutting down Tullia task build time by putting facts in
  JSON files.
- Fixed running into kernel arg limit by reading tullia's DAG from a file
- Merged [[tullia-pull-9]] that fixes several issues related to error reporting.
  and escaping.
- Added Mac builders in Cicero on CI-World.
- Started work on Tullia invocation caching.

## Spongix

- A lot of progress on an SQlite backed version of Spongix, it already supports
  the full HTTP binary cache protocol but still lacks comprehensive testing and
  some tuning, as well as recursive lookups.
- First steps in the implementation of the `nix-daemon` `ssh-ng` protocol so
  Spongix can be used via SSH and we can get rid of basic auth.

## Bugs

- Discovered Cicero bug where Nomad reschedules cause the Github commit status
  to get stuck in `pending`
- Discovered Cicero race condition bug around concurrent transactions for
  codependent actions.
- Fixed tullia task order bug in [[cardano-addresses]]
- Diagnose Cicero action not triggered in [[abcirdc]]
- Fixed meta/description of the Tullia package in [[tullia-pull-7]]
- Add Vault token loop alerts in [[bitte-cells-pull-40]]
- Ongoing investigation on recurring Patroni and nomad-follower issues related
  to token rotation.
